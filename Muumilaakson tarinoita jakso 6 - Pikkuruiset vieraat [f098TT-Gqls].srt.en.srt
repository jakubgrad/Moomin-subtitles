00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:14,000
It's fun to get letters, at least once in a while.

2
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Letters are somewhat rare in Moominvalley, but there are mailboxes and even a post office.

3
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Hi, hi!

4
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Did you yell at me?

5
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
There is a letter for you!

6
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Aputo, aputo!

7
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Yes?

8
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
It's coming now! Help! Help!

9
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Aha, Pepsi!

10
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Did you dig the hole?

11
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
I dug and it worked!

12
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Who actually pulled this prank?

13
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I guess that's not what happened.

14
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
You brave, have you dug a hole?

15
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Of course not.

16
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Who then?

17
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Yes!

18
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Ai!

19
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
You too!

20
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000
My postman, could I get that letter?

21
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Stop for several songs!

22
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Mom, there's a letter.

23
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
A good time letter.

24
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Yes, from mymmell.

25
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
On.

26
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Where is Smyy?

27
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Running somewhere.

28
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Tell me about the letter.

29
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
My sister likes it.

30
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
I don't know.

31
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
He left to take a vacation from me.

32
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
He'll come back now, won't he?

33
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Won't come.

34
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:16,000
If he has any sense, I fell into the pit for the third time.

35
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:21,000
I know, but I wasn't there to see the first two times.

36
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,000
You're a piece of shit, you horrible bastard.

37
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
I almost fell.

38
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
When you just fall.

39
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,000
You horrible bastard, you're sick.

40
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Mymmeli is back.

41
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
He feels that he can handle selling again.

42
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Great stuff.

43
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,000
We should go and clean the mummy's house.

44
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Does the little girl know that her sister is coming back?

45
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
No.

46
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Apparently my postman is still chasing him.

47
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Don't bother telling me why.

48
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Moomivamva!

49
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:09,000
That the letter is from Mymmule, what is he writing?

50
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:17,000
After a few days, Moomin returned to Moominvalley.

51
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Mymmeli is much bigger than mye and calmer.

52
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
There's Moominvalley over there.

53
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Is it full of nasty creatures?

54
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Not to my knowledge.

55
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Look at the smoke!

56
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Smoke means food.

57
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
It's a Moomin house.

58
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Are you also on your way to the Moomin house?

59
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Yes, we thought so.

60
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
That's what happened. I'll go there too.

61
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:03,000
The suitcase looks heavy. Shall I help you?

62
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
No!

63
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Right?

64
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Not then.

65
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
What kind of people live in the Moomin house?

66
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Were you thinking of staying the night?

67
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
If they are nice.

68
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
They are really nice.

69
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
My little sister lives with them.

70
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Well, shall we go?

71
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
What is it?

72
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Go ahead of you.

73
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
In for a penny in for a pound.

74
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Mimmel!

75
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
How are you?

76
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Good! Have you gotten a break from me?

77
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Have to! Everyone is waiting for you!

78
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,000
By the way, two little strangers are coming here.

79
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Did it look better?

80
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
For you?

81
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
They are about the size of a mole.

82
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Well-being.

83
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,000
And they're dragging a big suitcase.

84
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,000
And then to a very small double bed.

85
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Thanks for the coffee.

86
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Well, shall we go home?

87
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Little sells. Come on.

88
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Not yet.

89
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
We have to go and fix the places.

90
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
The rooms must be ventilated.

91
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,000
I swept the floor of your household the other day.

92
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,000
And I left all the windows open.

93
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Thank you.

94
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Isn't it already a relief that you've been sleeping almost the whole time?

95
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Myy has been here.

96
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,000
I've had time to strain anyone even a hair's breadth.

97
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
I don't see the goblin.

98
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Hey hey!

99
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Yes.

100
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Father, what does that Jaaha mean?

101
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:01,000
That I can hear my thoughts again.

102
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
When the sell is gone.

103
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Hey hey.

104
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
You go and knock on the door.

105
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
What if someone comes and starts screaming?

106
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Maybe they will open.

107
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Go now, go now.

108
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Hey.

109
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Vomit!

110
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Sorry.

111
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
What happened to you two?

112
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Don't forget your suitcase.

113
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
What should we do?

114
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
What should we do?

115
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
I don't bite.

116
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
I'm a local police officer.

117
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Services to Moomin for ages and times.

118
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Police!

119
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
We are no longer thieves.

120
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
We are no longer thieves.

121
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
We are no longer thieves.

122
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Has anyone claimed that?

123
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Isn't it?

124
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Aren't you going to arrest us?

125
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Of course not.

126
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Go say hello to Moomin.

127
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
This suitcase is ours.

128
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Has anyone said otherwise?

129
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Just take it.

130
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
That's where you finally are.

131
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Are these your guests, the Moomin?

132
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
I suppose so.

133
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
And since they have a suitcase with them,

134
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
they are going to stay.

135
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Fun.

136
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Would it suit you?

137
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Of course.

138
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
I'm a Moomin.

139
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
I'm Tiuhti.

140
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
And this is Viuhti.

141
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Welcome.

142
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Step inside and make yourself at home.

143
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
I think we can stay.

144
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Let's hide the suitcase.

145
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
They really are weird.

146
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
They are.

147
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
How can I be of help today?

148
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
So let's bring it.

149
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
I heard that Mymmeli is back.

150
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Well, it is.

151
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Is he coming here?

152
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
No.

153
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
He left with the sale of his home.

154
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Just now.

155
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Clear.

156
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
You have to check all the little things with the police.

157
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
It is very important.

158
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Goodbye then, Moomin.

159
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
He has a crush on Mymmel.

160
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
But has Mymmeli fallen in love with him?

161
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
I don't know.

162
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
What are the guests up to?

163
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
They look scared.

164
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Thanks.

165
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
I have emptied the drawing boxes for you.

166
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Thanks.

167
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Thanks.

168
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Where do we put the bag?

169
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
In the drawing box?

170
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
You can hide it here.

171
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Oh look, we've got beds like this made for us.

172
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Let's hide the suitcase in the drawer of the drawing.

173
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
We must be on our guard.

174
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
I like the rest of us, they don't scream at all.

175
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Still, we must be on our guard.

176
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Special guests like our house.

177
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
But those two are from the most special end.

178
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Jaa, they are from the north.

179
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Hence the names Tiuhti and Viuhti.

180
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Not this suitcase.

181
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
They seem like refugees to me.

182
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
They give you the law.

183
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Do you want to see them?

184
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Well yeah, isn't he?

185
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Ha, there you are.

186
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
What are they doing?

187
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
No clue.

188
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
There was nothing but rustling in the room.

189
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
We think that newcomers are refugees.

190
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
How is their suitcase?

191
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
My brother?

192
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Or state secrets?

193
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
That they are not arsonists.

194
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Let's hide the matches.

195
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Enemies of society one and two.

196
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
They don't look like it.

197
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Do you take a snus and a pinch?

198
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Thanks.

199
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Cookies too please.

200
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Joo.

201
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Tightly.

202
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Also the suitcase is gone.

203
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
What do I do now?

204
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Did you get up?

205
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Oh, you were under the year.

206
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
It's the safest place.

207
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Something small can fit.

208
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
What?

209
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Seseminot woke up that it would come.

210
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
It can't know we're here.

211
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
You never know, and it's coming tonight.

212
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
It certainly will.

213
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
It's windy there.

214
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
And suddenly it's terribly cold.

215
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Hey.

216
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Did you take a sweet nap?

217
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Join the club.

218
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Ha, there they are.

219
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Here's Nipsu and a nosegay.

220
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
You don't have to be afraid of them.

221
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
What is it?

222
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
It will come.

223
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
It will be.

224
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Who is it?

225
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
It will come.

226
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
It will be.

227
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Who the hell is coming?

228
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Bogey.

229
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
It's creepy.

230
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Creepy that bastard.

231
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Do you know about it?

232
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:35,000
I haven't seen it, but it's a scary monster.

233
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Scary monster.

234
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
And it follows you.

235
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
It will be here very soon.

236
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Don't be afraid.

237
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
It's not like that moron starts arguing with me.

238
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Isn't it.

239
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
But if it's a monster.

240
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Monster or not.

241
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Guests are always safe in the Moomin house.

242
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
You two go to your room.

243
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
You locked all the doors.

244
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Thank you, Moominpapa.

245
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Nobody gets through this.

246
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
No.

247
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Hands up, family.

248
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Rock.

249
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Hands up, family, dear.

250
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Anyone for more tea?

251
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
What is it?

252
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
A monster is attacking us, Mummy Moomin.

253
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Jeez.

254
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Mamma, get the frying pan in case of a fight.

255
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Everyone has decent weapons, right?

256
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Started.

257
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Vendeirausta-

258
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Dmm4

259
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Tomi

260
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Bare a fasten

261
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:08,920
Tell me

262
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:11,500
He took it off

263
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:14,520
R forward

264
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:16,520
Um...

265
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:23,520
Hoi!

266
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:27,520
Oh, midnight.

267
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:30,520
There is no such thing as a stupid sign.

268
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:32,520
I hope not.

269
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:42,520
It will come! It's here!

270
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:45,520
Very close.

271
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:58,520
Absolutely insane.

272
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:02,520
I'm going home, I'm sleepy.

273
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:04,520
We can't stay up all night.

274
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:07,520
All right.

275
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:09,520
I'm leaving now that you know.

276
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:11,520
Remember cell phone.

277
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:14,520
Just take the open road.

278
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:17,520
You're trying to scare me.

279
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:21,520
I don't get scared easily.

280
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:27,520
It's here.

281
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:29,520
And it's not!

282
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:31,520
There are no signs.

283
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:34,520
A sudden gust of wind blew the candles out.

284
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:45,520
There's nobody there.

285
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:50,520
There's nothing stopping the nips from going home.

286
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:58,520
Admit that there is no such thing as ice cream.

287
00:16:58,520 --> 00:17:00,520
You just scared me!

288
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:04,520
Petipuetta!

289
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:14,520
Not a living soul.

290
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:16,520
Not a living soul.

291
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:40,520
Don't crash like that.

292
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:42,520
It's here!

293
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:44,520
Where?

294
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:46,520
There, right outside the door.

295
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:52,520
Don't open the door!

296
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:55,520
Forward.

297
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:04,520
Not a soul.

298
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:06,520
Right?

299
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:10,520
Do you just exist?

300
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:13,520
Are you sure?

301
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:17,520
I guess you're right.

302
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:19,520
Not a soul.

303
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:21,520
We pushed it through.

304
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:25,520
Marke put his feet down.

305
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:27,520
That's it.

306
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:45,520
Dude, we'd be happy if you went home.

307
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:49,520
You're making our guests nervous.

308
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:51,520
You frost the roses.

309
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:53,520
Leave mom's flowers alone.

310
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:56,520
You have to leave.

311
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:59,520
Leave before I count to ten.

312
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:01,520
One.

313
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:03,520
Two.

314
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:05,520
Three.

315
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:07,520
Four.

316
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:09,520
Five.

317
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:11,520
Let's see.

318
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:13,520
Eight. Nine.

319
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:41,520
Old man!

320
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:48,520
Are you OK?

321
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:50,520
Look at the country.

322
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:54,520
Stupid.

323
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:06,520
Roar's voice.

324
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:09,520
Hey, when it got cold.

325
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:10,520
So it happened.

326
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:12,520
Mörkö won't be back tonight.

327
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:15,520
Let's go in and get something hot to drink.

328
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:19,520
And Mörkö didn't come back that night.

329
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:24,520
But why was it sneaking around the corners of Moomin House in the first place?

330
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:26,520
Is it still coming?

331
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:29,520
When everyone is sleeping.
