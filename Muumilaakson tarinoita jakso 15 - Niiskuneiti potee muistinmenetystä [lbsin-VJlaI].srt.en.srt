00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:22,000
All last week, the wet lady had been lounging on the couch reading fairy tales, but that day Moomin finally got her out.

2
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Yes, fairy tales always win.

3
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:38,000
You're glad you came along, niiskunnie.

4
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Moomin, look! Alpine star!

5
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Alpine stars don't grow here. It can't possibly be an alpine star.

6
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
It's an alpine star like in little Heidi.

7
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
It's not humid.

8
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Oh let's go pick it up.

9
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Don't go, it's dangerous.

10
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
You get to pick it up.

11
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
It's just a white anemone.

12
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,000
A clear alpine star appeared. I want me to pick for me.

13
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:19,000
You could try down there, but the alpine star is not a flower. Alpine star grows in the Alps.

14
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
It's an alpine star.

15
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Carefully.

16
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Fairy tales don't care about dangers.

17
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
That's why they are called fairy tales.

18
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Beautiful princess, accept a humble gift from the worshiper.

19
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,000
This good you will be thought of. Voisi is not an alpine star.

20
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,000
What did I say? It's not easy to get down from here.

21
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Aren't we going back to where we started?

22
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,000
I think that's the easiest way to get down.

23
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
You could be right.

24
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
At least this route is shorter.

25
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
And easier too.

26
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,000
I am frankly surprised that you are such an agile climber.

27
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Oikoninkalians are agile wherever they go.

28
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
So when you don't shut up.

29
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
So when you don't shut up.

30
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
So when you don't shut up.

31
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
How many emmies are there in this flower?

32
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
One, two...

33
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Good lord, a snowball in the middle of summer.

34
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Well, it doesn't move the horticulturist.

35
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Let's count now. One, two...

36
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Have you ever seen a lady like that?

37
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Well, I don't. That just left a size snowball.

38
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
That was when Miss.

39
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Not when the lady is made of snow.

40
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Niis this is a neiti.

41
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Weapons are nice.

42
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Thank you beautiful. He breathes.

43
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
He just got a kick and passed out.

44
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Moomin, what happened to him?

45
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
He bought the wrong way.

46
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
What are you trying to do?

47
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Money him home to mom.

48
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Heavy, sturdy tulle.

49
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Maybe he will if we pour cold water on his face.

50
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
How do we get water here?

51
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Tear off that fallen birch tree and make a cap.

52
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Clear. So I was looking after a lady at that time.

53
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Niis kun neiti, hoi!

54
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Cold.

55
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Did he wake up?

56
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
No.

57
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Good, he's off duty.

58
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Is everything alright then miss?

59
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
How do you feel?

60
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Where am I?

61
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
In the lonely mountains.

62
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Who am I?

63
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Well, the princess of the lonely mountains.

64
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Oh princess?

65
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Well, of course.

66
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
who are you

67
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Prince of the Lonely Mountains.

68
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
What?

69
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Such a ridiculous looking prince.

70
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
You are a teddy bear.

71
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
And I'm not.

72
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Don't laugh, Kallirenki.

73
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Yes?

74
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,000
So when the lady has lost her memory.

75
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
It's not, he pretends.

76
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,000
There is no whispering in the company of Kunin Kalliste.

77
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Excuse me, Your Highness.

78
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Oh, you poor bastard.

79
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Your castle, princess, good.

80
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Oh, the royals don't live in heckles.

81
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
But then, miss.

82
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Fool, don't use that dreaded name.

83
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Sorry, princess.

84
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
My real castle is elsewhere, isn't it?

85
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
That could be a hunting lodge.

86
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Absolutely.

87
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
That's what it is.

88
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Good. I can accept that.

89
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Let's go.

90
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Let's go.

91
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Let's go.

92
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
I can accept that.

93
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Well, what are you staring at?

94
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Courtier, send the Maid to my room.

95
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Camarinate?

96
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
And what did that courtier mean?

97
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Speak up.

98
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Dad, have you seen my aunt?

99
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
I am.

100
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
He's become a chump.

101
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Mom, would you like to talk to my cousin?

102
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Are you in conflict?

103
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Emme.

104
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
But my mother has got it into her head that

105
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
she is a princess.

106
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Ai.

107
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Ai.

108
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Oh, Nanette.

109
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Come here.

110
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Vai Nanette.

111
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
I am a Moomin.

112
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Let's stop this name mess.

113
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
You are Nanette.

114
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Ai.

115
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
It hurts.

116
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Oh, my swan and crown embroidered nightgown.

117
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
How's your little sister doing?

118
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Otherwise fine, but he's imagining things

119
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
being a princess.

120
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Could it be dangerous?

121
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
I don't think so.

122
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
I called her princess,

123
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
but only in my play.

124
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Glad you didn't coloraturate as a soprano.

125
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
So is my mother sleeping?

126
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
I wore crowns and swans in embroidery

127
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
in a nightgown, but now

128
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
so my mother wants to go to bed

129
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
of baltakin.

130
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
What is it?

131
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
A bed canopy with a canopy stretched over the posts

132
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
and tassels in the corners.

133
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
So my mother got nervous when

134
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
the baltakini was not ready.

135
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
As long as tomorrow morning

136
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
wakes up, his memory has been able

137
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
to return, and no baltakin

138
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
then no longer needed.

139
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Let's hope for the best.

140
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
What if his memory is not

141
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
back?

142
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
We'll see then.

143
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Baltakins are hardworking.

144
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Let me try.

145
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Trying what?

146
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
How?

147
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
As soon as my mother remembers who I am,

148
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
then everything else comes back to his mind.

149
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Sell, listen.

150
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
He doesn't even remember me.

151
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
How would I remember you?

152
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Because you can't forget me.

153
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
That's true.

154
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Sleeps like a log.

155
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Glad we did though

156
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
baltakine. It seems

157
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
wonderful.

158
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
He opens his eyes.

159
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Are you awake?

160
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Up, then, ma'am.

161
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Shall we go to the beach?

162
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Who is that person?

163
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
You have to remember.

164
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
I bit you yesterday.

165
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Terrible fun.

166
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Do you remember me?

167
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Of course I remember.

168
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
What did I say?

169
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
I am...

170
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
My other courtier, of course.

171
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
You are such a fool of yours.

172
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Better than that fatter jester.

173
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Better?

174
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
he i, ha Isu Li.

175
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
What things do you move with?

176
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Moomin has invited me

177
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
here to propose to a princess.

178
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Even the Moomin has squealed.

179
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
There must be a point of comparison for us.

180
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
That what?

181
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Are you there?

182
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
my competition matches or?

183
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Yeah, Kosia has to answer

184
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
actually that

185
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
I have winked.

186
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
I've winked.

187
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
I've winked.

188
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
The suitor must answer correctly

189
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
to three questions to get the princess

190
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
and half the kingdom.

191
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Not at all original.

192
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Exciting.

193
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Is the kingdom worthy?

194
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
The first competition

195
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
to try their luck.

196
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
I'm going.

197
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Good day, princess.

198
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Is that person

199
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Kosia?

200
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Yes, princess.

201
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
He did not greet me properly.

202
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
I'm sorry

203
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
your royal highness,

204
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
but this Kosia is

205
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
a foreign countryman.

206
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Just like that, maybe from a strange country.

207
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
It's good to prepare

208
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
to the first question.

209
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
It's not difficult.

210
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Yellow with four legs,

211
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
who sings.

212
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
What is it?

213
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Kannaria bird.

214
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Who has four legs.

215
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
I don't know any four footed bird.

216
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Who said it's a bird?

217
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
What is the correct answer,

218
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
get down?

219
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Let him be public.

220
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Slap him on the spot

221
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
knock out.

222
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
The stresses of the trip have taken their toll on Kosia

223
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
temporarily out of business.

224
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Hey, wait a minute!

225
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
You're out of my way, but Niskuneiti is.

226
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
What is the correct answer?

227
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
It's none of your business.

228
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
I believe you are of low birth.

229
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Sorry you have to put up with this.

230
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
A funny looking young man.

231
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
I have the honor to close

232
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
to popularity.

233
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
For him I must

234
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
questions.

235
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
I ask you,

236
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
what is the number that

237
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
i think

238
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Two.

239
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Well done, brave knight.

240
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Next you may need a word,

241
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
which is just on my mind.

242
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Love.

243
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Amazing.

244
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
This Kosia is indeed

245
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
knowing face.

246
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
You will hear the third question.

247
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
I have two figures in mind.

248
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Two.

249
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Was that right too?

250
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
No.

251
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Correct chapter 22.

252
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
I should have said

253
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
that the answer was correct.

254
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
The young man was very kind.

255
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Now it's your turn, skunk.

256
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
I saw the princess

257
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
and you half the kingdom.

258
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
What if the memory of the fallen

259
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
not coming back?

260
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Yes it will come back.

261
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
He does not match the image of Nicosia.

262
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
His heart

263
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Hug and pay attention to them.

264
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Well, just like that.

265
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Well, that's the first question.

266
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
What a number

267
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
I'm just thinking?

268
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Stupid question from Samper.

269
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Time passes, time passes.

270
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
no ha

271
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Six.

272
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
I intend to figure 3 million

273
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
598.765

274
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Ai.

275
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Hi vi, Nikos already.

276
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
This is not fair.

277
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Outrageous, head off.

278
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Another stupid question.

279
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Just go home.

280
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Kill half the kingdom.

281
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Oh, what a rude way to propose.

282
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
I'm not in the mood to get married.

283
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:26,000
An excellent idea, Your Highness.

284
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:30,000
I reject the remaining suitors with sadness.

285
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Please tell me to come home.

286
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Yes, Your Highness.

287
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:39,000
You are the kind knowing you who feel miserable.

288
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:42,000
From now on, I dedicate it to good work.

289
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Hey!

290
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Whoah! Now, what kind of excellent little girl has she got on her head?

291
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:54,000
He meditates upstairs and intends to devote his life to higher things.

292
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Like worth what?

293
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Niskunneiti dedicates herself to good deeds.

294
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:03,000
He obviously wants to enter the pages of history.

295
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Shhh! He's coming down.

296
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:14,000
May I assist your excellencies here?

297
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
At that time, a young lady came to me.

298
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Your maid is busy.

299
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Someone else could make the soup nutritious, but not great.

300
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Do you agree?

301
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
That's right, Narini.

302
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,000
I'm going to distribute it to the poor of mummy valley.

303
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
What kind of deal?

304
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
I don't know.

305
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
Keep eating and cooking.

306
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:40,000
The poor are fine with whatever the princess is willing to bring them.

307
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:46,000
Niskunneiti wants to catch up.

308
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:53,000
The poor don't eat much. This is perfectly fine.

309
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:57,000
I don't know anyone as poor in these lands as your highness.

310
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:00,000
The poor are the backbone of the kingdom.

311
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
What, hovinarini.

312
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
What now?

313
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:21,000
I take soup to the poor, which I have prepared with my own tender fingers.

314
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
Where are they?

315
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Oh, the poor! I tell you what.

316
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:29,000
That's good. Oh, lead me now the poor life of the kingdom.

317
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
All right, princess.

318
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
That house!

319
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:45,000
It's nice to know that the poor in my kingdom are so well off.

320
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Oh you there. Please come here.

321
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Who is there?

322
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
A lonely night princess.

323
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
One moment, Your Highness.

324
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
Don't make me wait.

325
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
I'm coming, I'm coming.

326
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,000
I beg your pardon, Your Royal Highness.

327
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
What the hell is that swamp lady?

328
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:22,000
That mean-spirited name. I'm a princess.

329
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:26,000
It would probably make you feel better when you come here as one of the better ones.

330
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Or my betters? Are you the queen?

331
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,000
I'm Mrs. Vilijonkka. what do you want

332
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:36,000
I'm just doing my royal duty.

333
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,000
By bringing comfort to the poor of the kingdom.

334
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
Here, eukko parka.

335
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:44,000
How dare you call me poor.

336
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,000
You who don't even own a sweater.

337
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:51,000
The intoxicating smell of sopa has apparently thrown you off your tracks.

338
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
Eat your soup yourself!

339
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Fraud! I want to guard, so Pertuska will take me here right away.

340
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:05,000
I don't see, I don't see. I don't see anything, I don't see anything.

341
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:08,000
That's right for you, niiskunkunnie.

342
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Wet!

343
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,000
Don't use that name again! Don't, don't!

344
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Stand your ground your highness.

345
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:20,000
Don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't!

346
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't!

347
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Stand your ground, Your Excellency.

348
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
Knock him down.

349
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
Bowl and catch up now.

350
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
It is.

351
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
Oh, light up the royal hippie.

352
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:36,000
I will free Niiskuneidin. Now I strike.

353
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:41,000
Little sell don't. My precious family will be shattered into a thousand pieces.

354
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:44,000
I'm thinking of Niiskunneidi's day thief.

355
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,000
Don't get stabbed, release me.

356
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
Clear!

357
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
Oh, it's so humid.

358
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:56,000
You shouldn't have hit that hard.

359
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:00,000
You don't know that. I've never helped a broken soup bowl before.

360
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
Is everything all right, Your Highness?

361
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
My Lord.

362
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:07,000
Would cold water help with this?

363
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:11,000
Mrs. Niiskunne hates it. Niskunkunnemi.

364
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:16,000
I don't think he'll wake up eleme talk to him your highness.

365
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
My Lord.

366
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
Here it comes!

367
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,000
Now he wakes up.

368
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,000
It's fun that the princess is with us again.

369
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:30,000
Does it hurt your highness?

370
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,000
Oh, where am I?

371
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:38,000
Uh, where else but on the ground?

372
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:44,000
Come on, I thought I was hiking in the lonely mountains with Moomin.

373
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,000
Niiskunnen, you remember me.

374
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:50,000
What do you mean, are you screwed?

375
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
Niiskunneiti is normal again.

376
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:57,000
How so again? I've been normal all my life.

377
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:01,000
Yes, of course, Niiskunneiti gold nub.

378
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
We are happy for you.

379
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:06,000
All's well that ends well.

380
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:11,000
How did it end well, all is well? I don't understand.

381
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:15,000
Five, that's all we were afraid of was that you hurt yourself when you fell.

382
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:20,000
That's how Niiskunneidi's short princess career ended.

383
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:24,000
Everyone was extremely relaxed.
