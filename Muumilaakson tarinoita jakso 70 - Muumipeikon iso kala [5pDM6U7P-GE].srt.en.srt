1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:17,000
What an early awakening.

2
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Sniff, little one!

3
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Good morning!

4
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Moomin and his companions are going fishing, and only Ani eats fish early in the morning.

5
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Good morning Snuska muikkunen!

6
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Good morning!

7
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Hello Moomin and Myy!

8
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
It will be a beautiful day, we will catch a lot of fish.

9
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Mmm, I'm taking you to a good place.

10
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Good, I'm right! I'm a fish!

11
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Mmm, about done.

12
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Low!

13
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Low!

14
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I'm coming!

15
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:24,000
H2O+, potato starch, polymer and mix, catalyst, C2H5OH.

16
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Jaha, have you been up all night?

17
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
A dispersion is formed and then the reaction et.i.

18
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Low!

19
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Here's how it goes.

20
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
What the hell is that?

21
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Niskun meat.

22
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Now look, such a simple formula.

23
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
What formula?

24
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
The glue formula I invented.

25
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:49,000
And it's not any ordinary glue, it seems to glue just about anything.

26
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Just what?

27
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Fabric, wood, metal, plastic, everything.

28
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
I'll start making the glue right away.

29
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Listen, Niska.

30
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Look, I'm going out with Moomin and the others.

31
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
can you hear

32
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
The food is ready on the table in the kitchen.

33
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Are you listening to what Nisku is saying?

34
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Good morning, Miss Nisku, good morning.

35
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Good morning.

36
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Hey there you are.

37
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Is it meant to wake up a twat?

38
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Joo.

39
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
There's something to be done, that's what I'm saying.

40
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Well, let's go already.

41
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Long from the waters.

42
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Uska muikkunen, will fish come up from this place?

43
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Absolutely.

44
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Nothing has come yet, I want nothing but non-existent fish.

45
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
There is something else.

46
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Even if it's an old shoe rack or a really great bunch of algae.

47
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Hi, I'm hungry.

48
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
It's a big fish.

49
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Don't push it away.

50
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
I dare you, little one.

51
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Don't take it easy on the hoods.

52
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
What's wrong.

53
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
The fish fights fiercely.

54
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Pulled it.

55
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Kala.

56
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Kala.

57
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Kala.

58
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Kala.

59
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Kala.

60
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Ha ha, valaaskala.

61
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Moomin got his fishing rod in the right fish tank.

62
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Moomin can.

63
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
We only caught one fish.

64
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,000
But there is enough to eat for everyone.

65
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Yes, Nipsu's boyless stomach bag will be full for once.

66
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Mii.

67
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Moomin, are you really going to cook the fish yourself?

68
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Yeah, cooking doesn't look difficult.

69
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Maybe it doesn't show.

70
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,000
I'll help if Moomin has a finger in his mouth.

71
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Koituskipa, help is needed.

72
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
I am available.

73
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Why does everyone think I need help?

74
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,000
I can read a cookbook.

75
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
There's no need for you to ask me to eat.

76
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Fish baked in the oven is good,

77
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
but there's no reason why fish tastes worse.

78
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Neither will you if I don't make it?

79
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Well, see you tomorrow.

80
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Hey hey.

81
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Wake up.

82
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Oh, good unusual.

83
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Wake up.

84
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Where does the smoke come from?

85
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Oh, here you are.

86
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
What are you doing in my kitchen?

87
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Hello, my sister, I'm about to finish boiling the glue.

88
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Didn't I say that you would only do the tests in your own room?

89
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Oh, how is this?

90
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Yes, remember to be careful when you walk.

91
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:35,000
I spilled a little glue on the floor.

92
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Remember to be careful.

93
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Delicious miracle glue.

94
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Hey, little one.

95
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
What's wrong now?

96
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Stop this startling rambling now.

97
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:53,000
It doesn't work, you have to boil the glue so that it thickens.

98
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
You're not ruining my hella.

99
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Oh, what a mess.

100
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
My new miracle glue.

101
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,000
You know that's my best pair of boots.

102
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
The only thing suitable for glue.

103
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
The sappa I just cooked for you.

104
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
JA took off his pants.

105
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,000
This is my favorite glue bowl.

106
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Well, it happened to be on the table.

107
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Oh my gosh, how could you.

108
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Deliver your disgusting substance immediately.

109
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,000
The test is in progress, as I said.

110
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,000
I mean nothing to you, do I?

111
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Of course mark, try try try try.

112
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
I'm try try try.

113
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Nothing for me, right?

114
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Mark of course.

115
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Try to understand that the exam is more important than my bowl of glue.

116
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Oh, you're destroying our home and you dare to talk about stupid tests.

117
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,000
You can be sure that everyone will get along without your glue.

118
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Just like before.

119
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
I'm leaving.

120
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
When you leave, right?

121
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Don't come back.

122
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Could he not be serious?

123
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Wow, what a catch.

124
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,000
I have rarely seen such a big fish.

125
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Can I make it myself?

126
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Well, sure.

127
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Can we manage to eat the whole fish?

128
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Hardly.

129
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:37,000
That's why I thought of organizing memorable fish cakes tomorrow.

130
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
I'm a great idea.

131
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,000
I bake a melt-in-your-mouth pie for dessert.

132
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
I have tasted your pie.

133
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
And when the oven got too hot.

134
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Yes, then.

135
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Father's bread plum pie.

136
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
The way you like it the most.

137
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Let it cool down without.

138
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Well, that's fine.

139
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Oh, You're not cooking are you?

140
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
I.

141
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
I.

142
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
I don't cook food for the damp.

143
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Don't you?

144
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
In.

145
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
I.

146
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
I.

147
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
I.

148
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
I.

149
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
I.

150
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
I.

151
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
In.

152
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Yeah right.

153
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
The glue is ready.

154
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Now the food tastes good too.

155
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Strengthen that glue again.

156
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
I have floated palm and mouth.

157
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
I'm getting wet.

158
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
I'm getting wet.

159
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Tomorrow boy.

160
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Aren't you awake yet?

161
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Wake up, yeah.

162
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
It's a lot of time.

163
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Today we are organizing those fish crackers.

164
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Let's work no matter how much.

165
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
The weather is wonderful.

166
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Breakfast is ready. Come down.

167
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Like.

168
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Delicious ash.

169
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Who is behind it?

170
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Oh, I'm getting wet.

171
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Oh, good morning grandma.

172
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Good morning Grandma.

173
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Well, tomorrow.

174
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
You have already prepared breakfast.

175
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
I thought it was the least I could do.

176
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Sell tomorrow. Why are you up so early?

177
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
None of your business.

178
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Tomorrow's rolls.

179
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Appetite.

180
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Oh good.

181
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Processed.

182
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Tastes like aini.

183
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Niisku front. Someone will make you the perfect wife.

184
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Ah. Isn't it Ihaa?

185
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
What do you mean?

186
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Guess.

187
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Oh my gosh.

188
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
I'm so quick in my turns.

189
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Oh.

190
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
I want to do everything myself.

191
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
From the start.

192
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
You would have cut the wound on your finger.

193
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Little sells.

194
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Today you have to help us.

195
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Who? Me?

196
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Because you live with Moomins.

197
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
You should help sometime.

198
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Don't sleep.

199
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
You don't need to help either.

200
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
I'm getting wet.

201
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
It's better for us to help.

202
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Niisku front. It's better for us to have you as our guest.

203
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Hey.

204
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
I might stay in the mummy house for a longer time.

205
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
I don't want to burden you under any circumstances.

206
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
I'm getting wet.

207
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Is something wrong?

208
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
No.

209
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
There isn't.

210
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
I'm not going to go back to insufferable brotherhood.

211
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Nice to have a little helper.

212
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Ai.

213
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
About arrest warrants.

214
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Mamma.

215
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
What's wrong daddy?

216
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
I think I'll stop by Niisku's.

217
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
I'll find out why Niisku's eti is angry with him.

218
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Even Niisku feels better when he knows that Niisku's eti is with us.

219
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
That's fine.

220
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
See you soon.

221
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Good luck on your journey.

222
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Share or that's the way things are.

223
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
What should I do?

224
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
So.

225
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
It's not very easy.

226
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
How about baking a pie?

227
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Or a pie?

228
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Exactly.

229
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
You say you're sorry.

230
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
And you offer reconciliation...

231
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
...hand.

232
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
And then you realize that you are really sorry.

233
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
And but Niisku's eti is so stupid.

234
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
In for a penny in for a pound.

235
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
But I can't guarantee the pie.

236
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
I have never baked anything in my life.

237
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Don't worry Niisku.

238
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
I'll help you with the baking.

239
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Take it as a science experiment.

240
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
As an experiment?

241
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Well why not.

242
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Good.

243
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
I suggest we start right away.

244
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Ready for dawn.

245
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Moomin is such a toupee.

246
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Even jump to dig if Niisku's eti tells you to.

247
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Moomin, when you have hung the lanterns...

248
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
...gather flowers for the table.

249
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Moomin suddenly.

250
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
I still need to cook the broth for the sauce.

251
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Great.

252
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Great.

253
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Great.

254
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Great.

255
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Grind pepper on top of the pieces of fish before putting them in the oven.

256
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Did you understand?

257
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Did you understand friend?

258
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
It's worth listening to.

259
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Wow dad.

260
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Hi sell.

261
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
What are you blowing?

262
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
You are picking plums.

263
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Plums?

264
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Yeah, I'm baking a pie.

265
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Huh, ollu.

266
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Papa Moomin has promised to help me.

267
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Yes, to agree with Ed of Niisku.

268
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Then I want to help too.

269
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
That's unheard of.

270
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Are you familiar with the secrets of cooking?

271
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:30,000
I know how to bake a pie even though I've never baked.

272
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Should have guessed.

273
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Or so?

274
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:38,000
I bake a worse pie than you.

275
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Is that so?

276
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
It's been bad luck so far.

277
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:46,000
The oven got too hot last time.

278
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
But now I can.

279
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Or so, well.

280
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
I read the instructions carefully.

281
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Is everything ready now?

282
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:00,000
There is. I wouldn't have made it without your help.

283
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Oh, you did most of it.

284
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:06,000
You are such a different character when you do household chores.

285
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Oh, is it me?

286
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
It's all Niisku's fault.

287
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Is it because of the humidity?

288
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:16,000
He doesn't care about anything but his exams.

289
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
He doesn't mind housework.

290
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Oh yeah, but he's a bit of an inventor.

291
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
And he will become famous.

292
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Niisku is a different country.

293
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Ai, ai.

294
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Ai, ai.

295
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Yes, I know.

296
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
I think I have been too demanding.

297
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
I apologize.

298
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Good idea.

299
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
It is already ready to sell.

300
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
And not! The dough is kneaded for a long time!

301
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Why hasn't a machine been invented for this job?

302
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
About.

303
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Hilno is ready.

304
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
The oven is hot enough.

305
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
The dough is not ready.

306
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Yeah, it looks pretty good to me.

307
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
But it isn't!

308
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Well, it is.

309
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
But I'll tell you what to do then.

310
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
Share, next we will hit the dough with a rolling pin.

311
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Am I not?

312
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
I'm ready.

313
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
I'm ready.

314
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Dough with a rolling pin.

315
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Not spread first?

316
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
First we hit with a rolling pin.

317
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Sounds weird.

318
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
But once you know...

319
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
The seller may be right.

320
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Baking is the job of pop men.

321
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Why does the dough behave like that?

322
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Curious thing.

323
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Now I remember what to do.

324
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
We sprinkle flour here so it doesn't stick.

325
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Absolutely. That's how it is.

326
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Isn't selling enough already?

327
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Suffice!

328
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
That's it, spreads well.

329
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
It's starting to look like a pie.

330
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Moominpappa's blows to Myy were like making a pie.

331
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
Hey!

332
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
debts

333
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Where did father and Little Myy disappear?

334
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
Well yes. They should come soon.

335
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
I shouldn't come soon.

336
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
Hello, Moomin Goblin.

337
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Evening.

338
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
Welcome to fish crackers. Thank you for coming.

339
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
Hello everyone.

340
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
Hi, Nipsu.

341
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Have you started? I'm hungry.

342
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:02,000
Moomin, would you be so kind as to bring the juice bottles from the kitchen?

343
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
I can apply.

344
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
I'll come along.

345
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
That's where dad comes from.

346
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
And the little one sells.

347
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
And Niisku.

348
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
Aha.

349
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Come to the table.

350
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
Thanks.

351
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
Let's get started.

352
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Miss Niisku, your brother came.

353
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
What Niiskuka?

354
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
So suddenly.

355
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
Put the juice bottles on the table.

356
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Tule.

357
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
Great.

358
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
Small.

359
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
Small.

360
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
Niisku, you haven't been seen.

361
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
How is your ship progressing?

362
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
Thank you very much.

363
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
An accurate miniature model is already ready.

364
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
Oh miniature model?

365
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
Joo.

366
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
Good smell.

367
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
There's something delicious about you.

368
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
What is it?

369
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
Nothing much.

370
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Moisture.

371
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
Moisture.

372
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Wet girl.

373
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
The one from yesterday.

374
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
I...

375
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
I...

376
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
I know, Miss Niisku.

377
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
I was wrong and I'm sorry.

378
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
Oh Niisku.

379
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
I have a little surprise for you here.

380
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
Oh Anka.

381
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
Jak's new invention, huh?

382
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
Not exactly an invention.

383
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
Soon.

384
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
Oh lovely.

385
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
Someone would suggest that you like

386
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
plum from the top so that...

387
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
And I did the dishes

388
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
your favorite dish too.

389
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
Oh, thank you, Niisku.

390
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
I am so happy...

391
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
Moisture,

392
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
i love you

393
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
wet girl,

394
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
don't stop, everyone is watching.

395
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
Let's see.

396
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:05,000
When Niiskunneiti and Niisku had made up, the parties could begin.

397
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:12,000
And surprisingly, Moomin's fishing line didn't turn out to be too big at all.
