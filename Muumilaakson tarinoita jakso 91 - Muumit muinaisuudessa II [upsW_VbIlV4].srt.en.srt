1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
I think this is going too far.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
I want to go back to Moomin Valley right away.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
This looks suspiciously like avico again.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
The time machine must have overheated in the sun.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
We need to get into the shadows to freeze it.

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
You know I get tired easily.

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
We have noticed it before.

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
I suddenly became terribly thirsty.

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Shit, you can't. We have no more water.

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I'm most thirsty.

11
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
You still can't drink everything.

12
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Hey, stop now.

13
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
I brought this field bottle.

14
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
I'll keep it from there.

15
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
I'll take the bottle.

16
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
It is...

17
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Hey!

18
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Water!

19
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Water!

20
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Hey!

21
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Oh!

22
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
What is it now?

23
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Momi Peikko!

24
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Come and go!

25
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Is everything okay?

26
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Look, over there!

27
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Oh!

28
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Ramidi!

29
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Ya Sphinx!

30
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Hey, I'm falling!

31
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
You are always the same!

32
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Whip it!

33
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Whip it!

34
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Whip it!

35
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Whip it!

36
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Whip it!

37
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
The pyramids!

38
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Help yourself with the riddles.

39
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
What exactly were the pyramids?

40
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Kind of graves.

41
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Building them was difficult.

42
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Dad, Do you know what's inside the pyramids?

43
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,000
It is shrouded in Darkness, but now we have an opportunity

44
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:59,000
reveals the words of the pyramids and leaves our mark on the history of archaeology.

45
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,000
The pyramid is guaranteed to be full of treasures!

46
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Oh, maybe real treasures!

47
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Hey, wait!

48
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Whip it!

49
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
You too!

50
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Where is the entrance?

51
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
After all, there should have been a door!

52
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
I'm going to dig into this.

53
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Are you sure it's safe?

54
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Hmm, one pyramid was built by many sexes.

55
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:41,000
I could almost bet that one troublesome tunnel won't hurt.

56
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
How's it going mummy?

57
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
The first one gets the treasure!

58
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Dig, dig!

59
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Just the first one?

60
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Just the first one?

61
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
You can't afford to be second!

62
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Moomin would wait a bit.

63
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Let's leave quickly!

64
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Yes. It took more time to build the pyramid than to destroy it.

65
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:27,000
So. I guess it wasn't planned terribly well.

66
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Good miracle. How do we get through this?

67
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Yes. I guess the pyramid needs to be rebuilt.

68
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:39,000
After all, it took many generations to build.

69
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
So.

70
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Yes.

71
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Yes.

72
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Ha! Let's escape!

73
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
A pinch! Be careful!

74
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Anna, excuse me.

75
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Are you making a fuss here? What have you done?

76
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:59,000
You have destroyed the tomb of the thousand-year-old king.

77
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:03,000
For that, we apologize a thousand times.

78
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Sorry.

79
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
That's not enough!

80
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Best to fade away!

81
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
A hopeless situation.

82
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Moomin-Pekko told to dig.

83
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:19,000
That's what you said! I tried to stop, but Moomin-Pekko said...

84
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:23,000
That's not true! Why are you twisting things again?

85
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Moomin-Pekko!

86
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Moomin-Pekko!

87
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Moomin-Pekko!

88
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Moomin-Pekko!

89
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Moomin-Pekko!

90
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Why are you twisting things again?

91
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Take off your disguises, even you wretched grave-robbers!

92
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Remove the masks from your faces immediately.

93
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Masks?

94
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000
We are not wearing any disguise.

95
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
It's a lie!

96
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Boy! Naomiot!

97
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Start! You ripped my head off!

98
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Must not!

99
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Stop it!

100
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,000
A little courtesy, if you can ask for permission.

101
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Don't, use those rough grips?

102
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Idiotit!

103
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Can't you see that this is my head and not a mask?

104
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Oh yes!

105
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Terribly rude people.

106
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Do not tickle.

107
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
It's true.

108
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
What is it about?

109
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Do not tickle.

110
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Forgive me.

111
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
We didn't know you were from the Land of the Sun.

112
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Others certainly wouldn't have been able to do this either

113
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:55,000
to destroy the Pyramid as easily and quickly as you.

114
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Ihi, take it easy.

115
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:09,000
The Mooms and I have come to earth to perform

116
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
special things to do.

117
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,000
It should have been noticed immediately,

118
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:19,000
but how about finding something to drink or eat here?

119
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Dude, don't get too excited.

120
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Let's disappear before they change their minds.

121
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Good idea.

122
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
You don't have to come and be escorted.

123
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
We're in a bit of a hurry.

124
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Not this water.

125
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Nipsu, you're coming.

126
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
We have to get away.

127
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Speed, speed, speed.

128
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:47,000
This time we come to the ancient Moomilaakso.

129
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,000
This is no Moomin Valley.

130
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Oh, what is that?

131
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
It plunges us into places.

132
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Keep it interesting.

133
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Oh, racing.

134
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Oh, unusual.

135
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:28,000
How can you beat tough men?

136
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Just different from the ones here.

137
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Who do you mean by lots?

138
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
At least not me.

139
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
And you don't outdo me.

140
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:42,000
If the world were different, I too would be a brave soldier.

141
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
That's right, honey.

142
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Even if you are somewhat overweight.

143
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Now.

144
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Now we don't divide.

145
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Tell me where we are.

146
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
At least not in Moomilaakso.

147
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:58,000
It seems we are still in the land of the Pyramids.

148
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,000
The time machine traveled too short.

149
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:11,000
The radiant Cleopatra enters the arena to hand out the prizes for the races.

150
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,000
What? My Cleopatra?

151
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Oh oh, the same beauty with a mighty fleet of Sails.

152
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,000
She is really beautiful in the picture.

153
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Yes, such a handsome and long linear nose.

154
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Oh, could I be just as beautiful and could I remain in history thanks to my beauty?

155
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Before you can go down in history, you have to die first.

156
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Cleopatra's beauty is just a joke.

157
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:59,000
She needs all the creams and dyes in the world to make her navel look great.

158
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Oh, to know the secret of her beauty.

159
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Miss Nisku, you're perfectly fine like that.

160
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Muvi-feikko, you don't understand anything about the essence of women.

161
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Neither do I.

162
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Not really.

163
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:20,000
No matter how beautiful a woman is, she always wants to be a little more beautiful.

164
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,000
It sounds really funny, but that's just the way it is.

165
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
You too mom.

166
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Me too a little.

167
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Hey, Cleopatra is leaving.

168
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Let's get after it.

169
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Short.

170
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
You go run.

171
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:38,000
How so where? After Cleopatra, of course.

172
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,000
We want to know his secret recipe.

173
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:45,000
If we get it, this time travel thing was worth doing.

174
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Whatever happens.

175
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Let's keep climbing.

176
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Mamma, wait, sell and I'll knock.

177
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:57,000
On what basis do you think Cleopatra tells you the recipe?

178
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
What are they waiting for?

179
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Waiting for their turn to win Cleopatra's lovely hand.

180
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Wow!

181
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Jubilee tea is popular.

182
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
A real star.

183
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:28,000
How long can it be before we get to see Cleopatra?

184
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Well, that's it.

185
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:33,000
The Queen is not in her sunniest mood.

186
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:38,000
It can take ten or even thirty days.

187
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Huh! So long!

188
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:46,000
I believe that we women can wait even a month if necessary.

189
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
In a breeze.

190
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
No, you're gloating.

191
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Honey, Will you hold a place for us in line while we do some research?

192
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
And you, Mi Pekka man?

193
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
I'll come along!

194
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Mamma!

195
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Mother!

196
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Everything here is so amazingly big!

197
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Oh my, what's wrong with you.

198
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:18,000
I've been away from the battlefield for three days.

199
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Now I'm done.

200
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Take the letter from Antony to Cleopatra.

201
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,000
We will deliver the letter for sure.

202
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
You can rest.

203
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
I'm borrowing this.

204
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Does it fit?

205
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Excellent.

206
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
It's too heavy.

207
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
It's too heavy.

208
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Yuh, my neck is going to snap.

209
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,000
That's how we skip the queues.

210
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,000
It is said in this letter of Antonius.

211
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:52,000
We must deliver the letter to Cleopatra without delay.

212
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Hi, that's it.

213
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
And the mother and the little girl.

214
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Let's go after them.

215
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Silvä.

216
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Silvä.

217
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Where are you going?

218
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
I guess you can see this.

219
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,000
A special express letter to Cleopatra.

220
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Sorry.

221
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Is it in the past?

222
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Good day.

223
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Mamma wait for us.

224
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Niskuneiti.

225
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
What is the matter?

226
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,000
We... that...

227
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Hey, what's up there?

228
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Now.

229
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:41,000
From what I heard, I would think that it is not appropriate to play in the palace.

230
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
This is far from a joke.

231
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
The floor is like a skating rink.

232
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Which of these rooms belongs to Cleopatra?

233
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
I don't know.

234
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:55,000
If I were to move to a palace, I would choose a room with the best view.

235
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Your opinion has not been asked.

236
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Niskuneiti's point of view makes sense.

237
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:05,000
The queen probably wants to keep an eye on her kingdom.

238
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
The matter is clear as day.

239
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Don't be shy.

240
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Upstairs!

241
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,000
O Antonius, my heart withers.

242
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Be prepared to die of grief.

243
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,000
What a charming room.

244
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Everything is so brilliant that it touches the eyes.

245
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:39,000
I would like to live this kind of life even once.

246
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Cleaning such a big room is hard work.

247
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Nipsu, leave some grapes for me too!

248
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Who there?

249
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Now let's take this book.

250
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Please leave.

251
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
And you don't want a letter?

252
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,000
I bring a message from Antonius.

253
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Oh, from my General, Antonius.

254
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
He is, he is so...

255
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
I picture beautiful.

256
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Is he?

257
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Mouthpieces!

258
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Antonius.

259
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:21,000
How can you make fighting more important than me?

260
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:26,000
You don't promise to come back until those stupid things are over.

261
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
What's wrong with Cleopatra?

262
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Oh Cleopatra rukka, sad.

263
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Let's leave him alone for a moment.

264
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Cleopatra is now not in a condition to hold a proper conversation.

265
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Oh, what do you think?

266
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Is there a key to the secret of beauty?

267
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Oh beautiful perfume bun.

268
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Hihi, a couple of sprays as a souvenir.

269
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Something smells in here.

270
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
I started to feel dizzy.

271
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Sell, may not use other people's goods without permission.

272
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Good luck!

273
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:09,000
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

274
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Good luck!

275
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Cleopatra, can we have these beauty products as souvenirs?

276
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:25,000
I have no reason to be beautiful anymore.

277
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Take what you want.

278
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:31,000
One's sorrow, another's happiness made us happy. Thank you, thank you.

279
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
All Antonios.

280
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,000
What the hell is wrong with Cleopatra?

281
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Without Antonius, my life is worthless.

282
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Take me to the world of shadows.

283
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Don't he now, you must not die.

284
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Did he try to kill himself with a poisonous snake?

285
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Kärmeen looks nice. It's unlikely to be toxic.

286
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
It doesn't have a poison tail.

287
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:03,000
Pinch, hey, let it bite you as a test.

288
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Don't joke!

289
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Are you okay?

290
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Are you messengers from heaven?

291
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Please take me out of here.

292
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Yeah, but...

293
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:22,000
He has suffered a lot. Honey, we'll take him with us.

294
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
A world of shadows?

295
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,000
No, of course, but to Moominvalley.

296
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Cleopatra overcomes her depression,

297
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:34,000
after he has rested his nerves for a while with us.

298
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Great idea. Everyone will be excited.

299
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
I'm already excited.

300
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:45,000
And I got to know Cleopatra's beauty routine.

301
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Well, let's get down to business.

302
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:50,000
I guess you can't wait to go already, Moominpapa?

303
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Without a doubt, with Cleopatra's help, we will still decide

304
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:56,000
The Riddle of the Sphinxes and Pyramids.

305
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
I'm sure.

306
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Suddenly, start the time machines!

307
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:10,000
Moominpapa, we will be found soon!

308
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:15,000
The time machines have to be adjusted to Moomin Valley and it is a precise job.

309
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Cleopatra!

310
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Cleopatra, I found you at last.

311
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Jaha, who are you?

312
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Cleopatra, I have returned to you, Cleopatra.

313
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Just like Antonius.

314
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Would have spoken.

315
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Oi Antonius!

316
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
Cleopatra!

317
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:44,000
O Antonius, are you really there?

318
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,000
I am. Let's see it with your own eyes.

319
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:52,000
Ah, so he is Cleopatra's lover.

320
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
General Antonius himself.

321
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Very handsome.

322
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
I've had enough of wars.

323
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:02,000
Even in the midst of the battle I could hear your sighs and complaints.

324
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:08,000
Then I felt great restlessness. From now on, it's just the two of us.

325
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
O dear Antonius.

326
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,000
Sorry. Go away.

327
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,000
Sorry, but...

328
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,000
Do not disturb.

329
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Shouldn't I...

330
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,000
Gosh!

331
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:22,000
General Antonius, is that sword real? May I touch it?

332
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Doing the same.

333
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Oh, how wonderful it is!

334
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,000
I live. That venomous snake doesn't...

335
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
Of course you live, Sweet Cleopatra.

336
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
Can I fit the helmet?

337
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
As you wish.

338
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
Great!

339
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
What a shining sword!

340
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
I think this is a nice place.

341
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
What bliss.

342
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:46,000
But I will order its swindler to be punished.

343
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,000
Cleopatra, it is good to be with you.

344
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,000
Hi Anthony! The sword was forgotten!

345
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
Also the helmet!

346
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:59,000
I have the love of Cleopatra. That will do.

347
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
Let us be.

348
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
I don't need anything anymore.

349
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
Not these too?

350
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
They are ours!

351
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
Amazing.

352
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:12,000
Love is indeed greater.

353
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:16,000
But you can keep the sword and the helmet even if you love it.

354
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:22,000
Right. But you also once said that if I just love you, you don't need anything else.

355
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:25,000
Oh, did I really say that.

356
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:29,000
Too bad Cleopatra isn't coming with us. Or what do you say?

357
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:34,000
I wish I could turn into a reindeer in the flames of love.

358
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:37,000
Phew! When you come back!

359
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
Cloudy.

360
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:04,000
Police Chief Awakened!

361
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
Did the Moomins return?

362
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
Not yet.

363
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:15,000
Can they get back to Moominvalley first?

364
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
No.

365
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
Let's go.

366
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
Let's go.

367
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
At our house.

368
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:26,000
Can they get back to Moominvalley first?

369
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,000
So. That's what I thought too.

370
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
Yay, that's weird.

371
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
We're back!

372
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,000
Welcome. We have time to worry.

373
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:52,000
The ancient Moomin Valley looked like.

374
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
Share, something like that.

375
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,000
Cleopatra, gave me this box.

376
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:00,000
The secret of beauty was found here.

377
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:04,000
Lovely Cleopatra! I came back.

378
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:09,000
Ah, Antonius my General, is it really you?

379
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:12,000
If you just love me, I don't need anything else.

380
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:15,000
You can't hurt yourself.

381
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:20,000
Humi Troll, love is not for you.
