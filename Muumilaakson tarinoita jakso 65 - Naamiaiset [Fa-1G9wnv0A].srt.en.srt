1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Moomin Valley is bathed in sunlight.

2
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Such a day makes you sing and dance.

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
So.

4
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
So struck.

5
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
What makes you sing today?

6
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
I'm so good to be.

7
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Nice day.

8
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I have a feeling something really funny is going to happen.

9
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
And exciting. Maybe there will be a whirlwind.

10
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Moomin troll.

11
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Moomin troll.

12
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I didn't even notice it. Hello.

13
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Where are you going?

14
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
As long as I go.

15
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Whereabouts?

16
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Come on, come on over to dad.

17
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Mom and Dad have something to tell you.

18
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Ai.

19
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Exciting.

20
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
No you you.

21
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Moomin already had time to leave.

22
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Maybe he came to meet you.

23
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Joo.

24
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
But he didn't say where he was going.

25
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Just like that.

26
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Moomin troll.

27
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Moomin troll.

28
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Moomin troll.

29
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Moomin troll.

30
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Moomin troll.

31
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Moomin troll.

32
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Moomin troll.

33
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Moomin troll.

34
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Moomin troll.

35
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Moomin troll.

36
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Moomin troll.

37
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Moomin troll.

38
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Moomin difference.

39
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Moomin troll.

40
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Moomin troll.

41
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Moomin troll.

42
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Moomin troll.

43
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Moomin troll.

44
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Moomin troll.

45
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Moomin troll.

46
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Moomin troll.

47
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Moomin troll.

48
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:21,500
We haven't had a fancy dress party in ages. They are kept on a leash in the manor.

49
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:24,500
Aaah, the one that's like a haunted house!

50
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:31,500
Pikkumyu, better people live in that house, more precisely the nobility of our kingdom.

51
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:36,000
The host is very kind to invite us.

52
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,000
I can reveal to you that I was told to be invited to a costume party.

53
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Every Moomin is a resident, isn't there a bigger one?

54
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
There will be a puff.

55
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
So food and drink?

56
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
You want to come too.

57
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Necessarily! And then we danced the night away!

58
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Isn't that so obvious?

59
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Ball...

60
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Dear Niiskun Eiti, I would like to introduce you to a young man.

61
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
For a teenager?

62
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Even for a noble. He is what was right for you?

63
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
A million!

64
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
What do you sell?

65
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Hoomipeikka is better suited to niiskunnei, and you can't woo me to that young man.

66
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:31,000
It's about time I got my own swing.

67
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Children, remember to be neat at the party.

68
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Don't judge someone's food.

69
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Mom, we're always neat at parties.

70
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Aren't you?

71
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
No, mom.

72
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
In Vittikomero, kommumimama!

73
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,000
So. Here probably.

74
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,000
It's been a long time.

75
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Let's see what's here!

76
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:15,000
I think it is completely unnecessary for us to dress up in fancy dress.

77
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:20,000
We fit in quite well like this.

78
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:25,000
You and I very well, but niiskunneid and mey need at least a wig.

79
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
A wig?

80
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Ugh, stupid!

81
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Moomin, this one?

82
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
It doesn't fit a bit!

83
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Just that. Let's think it's still in stock.

84
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:43,000
The wig is a bit out of shape, but luckily we have a whole week.

85
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
May I try it on?

86
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Just try it.

87
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Oh, that looks really nice, mister.

88
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Really? Did you wear this wig when you were young?

89
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:59,000
We wore wigs at the party, didn't we?

90
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
No, I remember.

91
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Moomin mama, at least this is a man's wig!

92
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Well, is that about...

93
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Dad used it.

94
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Do you have to keep all the junk? They only collect moths.

95
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Hypsis, this will make a good wig for sale.

96
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Will you come?

97
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,000
I'll make it a little smaller so it fits like a glove.

98
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Thank you, Moomin Mama! Put the wig on, I'll read all the masks from the board.

99
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:34,000
So sure. All the young men are going out of their way to pick you up for the dance.

100
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
What happened to you?

101
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
I'm excited!

102
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,000
How can I wait a week?

103
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Hi, what are you eating? Nuts?

104
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Nuts taste awful.

105
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Hey, come play.

106
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Hey, don't run away!

107
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
No hello, Hemuli!

108
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
I'm bored.

109
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,000
It's no fun playing hooky alone.

110
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,000
And I'm not kidding.

111
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Need a playmate?

112
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Then jump to Moomin to play. And don't be in my shoes.

113
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Moomin is never home and everyone else is getting ready for a costume party.

114
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:49,000
I know. You don't even hear talk about anything else these days.

115
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:55,000
If only I knew how great it is to dress up for some silly prom.

116
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Absolutely blown away. I'd rather watch a tumor than dance in its pus.

117
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
In a mess?

118
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
No.

119
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Hello, Snuska-muikkunen!

120
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Hey!

121
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Aha, I'm starting to understand why you haven't been seen.

122
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Canoe or not?

123
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:38,000
It's a lot of hard work when you're trying to tinker alone.

124
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:43,000
I know, but I want to survive without the help of others.

125
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:48,000
You wanted to build a canoe in secret and then surprise everyone.

126
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Well, that's what I thought, but now you saw what I was doing.

127
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Oh, sorry. I hereby happily forget that I saw what you were doing.

128
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Can you forget?

129
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Of course. I forget what I want.

130
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:08,000
I'm thinking about something else and I'm like, I've forgotten.

131
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Let's hold launching ceremonies when the canoe is ready.

132
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,000
You are the guest of honor!

133
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
I came.

134
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Well welcome.

135
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Are you amazed?

136
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Moomin Pekka, what's wrong with you?

137
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Are you a wet girl?

138
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,000
No, but the duchess, who resembles the lady of the meadow.

139
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:48,000
We are in a big hurry to get everything done by face.

140
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Next next next next next next next next.

141
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:00,000
We are in a big hurry to get everything ready for the masquerade.

142
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Oh yeah, to that costume parade.

143
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
It's prom!

144
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Moomin-Pekka, how do you dress?

145
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Me?

146
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Come up with something, the party is for four days.

147
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Four days?

148
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Moomin-Pekka has to dress up as a prince, right?

149
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:24,000
No, when for a swineherd who secretly loves me, a meadow lady can take that nobleman.

150
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:28,000
No, Moomin is a prince, and he is my cavalier.

151
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
I'm hungry.

152
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:33,000
You will get food right away, we have already eaten.

153
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Moomin-Pekka can be the servant of both of our prince stories.

154
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:42,000
No way, she appears as a black woman. That's right.

155
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Servant or black knight, it doesn't matter, but do I have time to prepare?

156
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Of course, we will help you.

157
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Moomin-Pekka can just as well be in Tartsa's, Leopard's stables.

158
00:09:55,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Well thought, powerful Tartsan will carry us on the dance floor in his arms.

159
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Tartsan must have a crocodile. Nipsu would play a role in that, all his own.

160
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:10,000
That's right, let's start making a mask for the trinket right away.

161
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Moomin-Pekka is on the trail early.

162
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:28,000
How far can the spur be?

163
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Oh yeah, I can't watch. I mumbled to him.

164
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Good morning!

165
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Good morning.

166
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Ha, hypocrite!

167
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Aisuli will definitely notice Moomin-Peko's carrier.

168
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Finally, the day of the masquerade dawned. The police chief is looking for a lady.

169
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Who is there?

170
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,000
I? I came to get you.

171
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Oh, your suit is so familiar.

172
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Wearing a police helmet on purpose, I look just like your assistant.

173
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Wait a minute, Rova-Viljonkka. I'm not coming to the masquerade.

174
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
You are my cavalier.

175
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,000
I don't have time. I'm going to collect plants.

176
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Guaranteed not. You go to a costume party.

177
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Yes, but Mrs. Vilijonkka...

178
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:06,000
If not, then no. It drains all the time.

179
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Bulge your abs.

180
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,000
I can be Tartsan if Moomin-Pekko doesn't want to.

181
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,000
I have a Tartsan top for Moomin-Peko.

182
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
He has used it before.

183
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
I'd rather be the Black Knight.

184
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Moomin, please, it's too late.

185
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Let's get that upper part. Where is it, Mummy Moomin?

186
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Isn't it in Moomin Peko's own room?

187
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Soon then! It's definitely time.

188
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Moomin-Pekko! Moomin-Pekko! Moomin-Pekko!

189
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Soon then! It's definitely time.

190
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Hey.

191
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Just don't say you're coming to the party too.

192
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Of course not.

193
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:53,000
I happened to pass by your construction site, and when you weren't there I stopped by here.

194
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Did you see my secret?

195
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,000
I don't. Of course I closed my eyes.

196
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Good. Nothing will come from work today, but the canoe is almost ready.

197
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Great. Not many days left, eh?

198
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Couple three.

199
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Well then, you could launch it right away.

200
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:13,000
I guess so. But it still has one thing and another to finish.

201
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:18,000
And what do you think? Could someone be pushing it into the water secretly from you?

202
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,000
I believe so. What do you mean?

203
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,000
I saw Haisuli sneaking over there.

204
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Did I smell?

205
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
And you haven't noticed anything?

206
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
I'm not.

207
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:32,000
What if Haisuli has fallen into a hole?

208
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Aha! Found!

209
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Moomin, look at this.

210
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Ugh! Where did you go?

211
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Rushed somewhere with the muikku.

212
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Moomin!

213
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
So what now?

214
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
You look just like Tarzan.

215
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Come on.

216
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Come on.

217
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
O Stink!

218
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Stop that, you rascal!

219
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:22,000
It won't stay on the surface. I wouldn't have believed it.

220
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,000
It's not ready yet. Come back.

221
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:29,000
This is fine for me. Edition you just dress up to celebrate.

222
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
I made the canoe myself.

223
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Listen Moomin, you have a really stylish loincloth.

224
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Moomin, don't come any closer than back.

225
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Watch out Stinker, the king of the Tartus jungle is coming and will tear your fur into swords.

226
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Good Moomin!

227
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:57,000
All the guests must have already arrived.

228
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Shouldn't have waited for the Moomin.

229
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,000
I think that Moomin is kicking his heifers.

230
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
You would have made me a tartan.

231
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:09,000
You cannot carry two princesses in your arms.

232
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
What exactly are you talking about?

233
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Quietly!

234
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,000
I'm a Moomin.

235
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
I'm a Moomin.

236
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Horse gallop!

237
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Nobody here in Moomin Valley has a horse.

238
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Look!

239
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Odd one out.

240
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
I'll drive him on his way.

241
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
What a scoop!

242
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Look, crocodiles don't bark.

243
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
An unusual dog.

244
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:45,000
He is the other, the other, the other, the other, the other, the other, the other, the other, the other, the other, the other, the other, the other, the other, the other, the other, the other, the other, the other.

245
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
An unusual dog.

246
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Is it yours?

247
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Yes, but he's a crocodile.

248
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
And we haven't met before.

249
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Emme.

250
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Mrs. Vilijonkka sent me an invitation to the dress prom.

251
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
But apparently I'm lost.

252
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
We are going to the same place.

253
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Maybe we can go the same way.

254
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
It's fine, how about me?

255
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Noble sir!

256
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
It would be fine for us to go on your sled.

257
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Just something.

258
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
It was lucky that we bumped into each other.

259
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Niiskunei is a nerve.

260
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
Boldly.

261
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
The dance may have already begun.

262
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Apparently.

263
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
Niiskunneiti finds herself in an embarrassing position without a cavalier.

264
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Perhaps.

265
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
He gets mad as hell.

266
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
Certainly.

267
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
Oh, how lucky we were to actually get to ride.

268
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
At least I feel like a princess.

269
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
With your kind permission.

270
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
I acted as a companion for both of you at the dance.

271
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
Permits will come!

272
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Maybe you'll also let me have a merry-go-round with you on the dance floor.

273
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
Oh sure.

274
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
The Moomin doesn't even have to come.

275
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
We don't need tartans.

276
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Even less crocodiles.

277
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Moomin troll.

278
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Moomin troll.

279
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
Moomin troll.

280
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
Moomin troll.

281
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
Moomin troll.

282
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Moomin troll.

283
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
Old man.

284
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Who do you

285
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
Hawks are eight.

286
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
Hawks are eight.

287
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Act Alexia.

288
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
Hawks are eight.

289
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Kuk points.

290
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Adjective to the extent of 杯c.

291
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
Keyword Bay part check.

292
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
keyword Bay part check.

293
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
The job was missing.

294
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
However.

295
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
No Brad punelee.

296
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Wait for me!

297
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:41,400
This menu will take forever before we get to the party.

298
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:45,200
Now don't think about it. You push, push, push!

299
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:50,200
Moomin bump into you.

300
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:07,800
Look at those two of the best Moomins I've ever seen, you must say.

301
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:11,400
Everything else. They have come into their own.

302
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,800
Cypress Magnifier!

303
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:18,000
Oh, I'm hungry.

304
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:24,800
To the dance floor! Let's dance hard to catch the others!

305
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:27,200
I want food first.

306
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:29,400
I'm going home.

307
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:31,000
We just got here!

308
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:35,600
I have lost a wig and a couple of days and a fan.

309
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:37,000
I don't care anymore.

310
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:40,400
You can borrow my wig!

311
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:42,200
Let's go dancing!

312
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:45,200
Let's rest a little first. I walked here.

313
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:48,200
My wig didn't get the perfect shade.

314
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:54,600
Oh, Rova-Viljonkko!

315
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:56,600
Oh, dear Marquis!

316
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:59,600
You have already seen the small shop.

317
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:03,600
I came to introduce you to another fine lady.

318
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Did I even hear the right way?

319
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:18,600
Yes, Beauty.

320
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,600
Dare, little one!

321
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:25,000
I've been here waiting for the lady to come back.

322
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,800
Oh, are you really?

323
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:31,800
Of course it's true. A private lotti awaits.

324
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:34,800
Follow me.

325
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:42,800
Moomin Goblin!

326
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,400
Oh, how Soma carried!

327
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:49,400
Did you do it yourself?

328
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:52,400
I am. Glad you like it.

329
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:54,400
Can I enter the old age?

330
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:57,400
Of course! Please, beautiful princess.

331
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:59,600
Thank you, Prince Soma.

332
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:12,600
Beautiful moon!

333
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:13,800
So.

334
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:17,800
In this regard, sail to the moon in this beauty.

335
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:18,800
Likewise.

336
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:22,200
And there we danced our heads off.

337
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:24,200
Joo.

338
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:28,200
And to the moon they flew.

339
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:31,200
Or at least they thought so.
