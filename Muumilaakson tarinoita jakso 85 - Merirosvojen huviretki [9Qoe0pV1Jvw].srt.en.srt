1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
I show with my neck.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Since you're going to hang it around your neck anyway, why did you even ask?

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
I still ask for my kindness, but I can't help but ask.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
I'm showing off to the granny troll.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
He always answers well as you wish.

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
I show with my neck.

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
I show with my neck.

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
I show with my neck.

9
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
I show with my neck.

10
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
I show with my neck.

11
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
I show with my neck.

12
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
I show with my neck.

13
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
He always answers well as you wish.

14
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Granny Goblin!

15
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Where has he disappeared to?

16
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Wake up!

17
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
What did Niisku see?

18
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
The boat sailed towards here.

19
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Twinkling unknown boat.

20
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Granny Goblin!

21
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
What did he like about water?

22
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
The boat sailed over him.

23
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Look back there granny troll!

24
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
The goblin squealed and got out!

25
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Don't wait!

26
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Dive in now, it'll bite your brain too!

27
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Wake up!

28
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Wake up!

29
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
There is more to worry about granny troll

30
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
than all others combined.

31
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Is everything okay?

32
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
All good.

33
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Horribly naughty sailing.

34
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Pursi heads to the Ipsu rock.

35
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm

36
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Not a single sint.

37
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
If I return home in style

38
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
can imagine selling.

39
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,600
Ipsu idiots!

40
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:59,600
Of course, tie the hook to the line, right?

41
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:11,600
What? Oh, yes I set the hook. No, you can't pull, I can't swim.

42
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:16,600
Stop, no, you can't. Help, help. Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.

43
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:24,600
Help, help, help, help, help, help, help, help, help.

44
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:29,600
Calm down, everything is fine. I was saved.

45
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:36,600
Well, family, new excursion spot. Go ashore.

46
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:41,600
We spent many hours at sea.

47
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:48,600
There don't seem to be any other hikers, but don't worry mom.

48
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:53,600
Yes, we'll make it. I don't think we have any friends other than each other.

49
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:55,600
A bit primitive.

50
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:04,600
Well, mom, let's roll. By the way, it's too quiet here.

51
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:06,600
Oh, you.

52
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:14,600
They use our beach.

53
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:17,600
Sly noisy. It annoys me.

54
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:20,600
The fun goblin went to drive them away.

55
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:22,600
Why? Why me?

56
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:24,600
You are the wisest.

57
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:26,600
They can be pirates.

58
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:30,600
I've never heard of pirates that dance.

59
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:33,600
All right. I'll go talk to them.

60
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:36,600
Good day.

61
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:38,600
Kas, have a good day.

62
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:40,600
What do you like about the beach?

63
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:42,600
Fine. Even without favors.

64
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:44,600
You can hardly even get a hamburger here.

65
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:46,600
But welcome to the club.

66
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:48,600
Aren't you just pirates?

67
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:50,600
Of course. How did you know?

68
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:52,600
We are, of course, our Meriroscope family.

69
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:54,600
I have to go.

70
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:56,600
Goodbye.

71
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:58,600
I was right. They are pirates.

72
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:00,600
What do we do now?

73
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:02,600
Oh, pirates.

74
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:04,600
I'm going to bite them so they leave.

75
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:06,600
And you won't go. Stay tuned, Simi.

76
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:08,600
They are pirates. What do we do now?

77
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:10,600
Oh, pirates.

78
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:12,600
I'm going to bite them so they leave.

79
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:14,600
And you won't go. Stay tuned, Simi.

80
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:16,600
They need to drive off our shores.

81
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:18,600
Beware of pirates.

82
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:20,600
Are you trying to say that we will let them take over our beach in peace?

83
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:22,600
I guess there's nothing else you can do here.

84
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:24,600
We have to drive them away so they don't realize we're behind it all.

85
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:26,600
And if that method doesn't work, I'm going to bite.

86
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:28,600
I have one inch.

87
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:30,600
Tell me.

88
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:32,600
Let's lie.

89
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:34,600
I'm going to bite.

90
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:36,600
I'm going to bite.

91
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:38,600
I'm going to bite.

92
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:40,600
I'm going to bite.

93
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:42,600
I'm going to bite.

94
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:44,600
Tell me.

95
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:46,600
They lie that the sea is teeming with sharks and other beasts.

96
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:56,600
I came to warn you.

97
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:58,600
Hello ma'am.

98
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:00,600
Oh from what?

99
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:02,600
There are sharks in these waters.

100
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:04,600
Great white killer sharks.

101
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:06,600
There they are again.

102
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:08,600
Ai, ai.

103
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:10,600
Sharks have caught many swimmers from the beach.

104
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:12,600
Fingers and noses wash up on the beach.

105
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:14,600
Hey, come out now.

106
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:16,600
Be careful, hey.

107
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:18,600
What?

108
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:20,600
Hi, hi.

109
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:22,600
A short walk to the beach.

110
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:24,600
Please wait for me.

111
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:26,600
No hurry.

112
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:28,600
Speed up, run for breath.

113
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:30,600
Speed up, run for breath.

114
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:32,600
Speed up, run for breath.

115
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:34,600
Speed up.

116
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:38,600
Hehe

117
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:42,600
We have a gun after all.

118
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:44,600
What are you driving?

119
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:46,600
I'll shoot it from the shark's breath.

120
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:48,600
Oh, no, no, no? Come on, that's not a good idea.

121
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:50,600
Don't stop me.

122
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:52,760
What if you have other vite cosa?

123
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:54,760
I mean your kids, no shooting.

124
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:01,960
Titten's shed for the present.

125
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:03,960
He's hooded.

126
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:05,960
What?

127
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:09,040
Oh, save, girl, save!

128
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:11,920
Yes, Voovi-Peikko will definitely save him.

129
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:16,320
Hold on to me.

130
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:18,800
That's what you saw.

131
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:23,360
Thank you, thank you, children.

132
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:25,640
You saved your daughter's life.

133
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:29,040
I don't even know how to reward you.

134
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:31,120
I can't thank you enough.

135
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:35,680
The girl would surely have either drowned or fallen into the teeth of a shark,

136
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:37,640
if you hadn't come to help.

137
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:40,360
They don't have much to give, but you take this.

138
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:43,200
No, no, I can't take anything. No kidding.

139
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:46,520
Who or... Please accept it as a token of our gratitude.

140
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:49,040
I'm so kind.

141
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:50,920
Thanks, Vaino.

142
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:55,960
Au!

143
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:59,720
Is something bothering you? No, no, no problem.

144
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:10,000
Oops, that was not a successful operation. What now?

145
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:13,920
So. They seem pretty nice to me.

146
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,080
Oh, you'd let them stay on the beach huh?

147
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:21,440
At least we could play together. The kids have a good ball.

148
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:26,160
Shut up. You only changed your mind because you got treats from them.

149
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:28,720
It's not true. Don't always misrepresent.

150
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:33,440
Hey, stop bickering. Sanaharkkai help us a bit.

151
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:37,520
I've lost my sister. I just don't know.

152
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:40,440
Where is your fighting spirit?

153
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:45,520
There's trash in that, too.

154
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:50,600
How naughty pirates throw trash around it?

155
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:56,280
Loudness can still be forgiven, but not littering the beach.

156
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:58,280
Littering the beach of Önäsity

157
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:06,680
Oh, you're probably the beach trash collector.

158
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:10,760
I can give you these scraps. I don't know where you put it.

159
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:12,840
Well, just thanks.

160
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:19,920
Voice, why is this tune getting so thick?

161
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:22,920
Thick?

162
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,000
That I'm fat?

163
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:28,080
You bitch!

164
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:30,160
You bitch!

165
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:33,240
Miss you, nothing...

166
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:36,320
Don't you collect roju collection?

167
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:39,400
What now? I'm going home.

168
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:41,480
You bitch!

169
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:46,080
What's wrong with you? We're coming home too.

170
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:49,160
Did I say something wrong?

171
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:51,400
I don't know.

172
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:57,480
Listen dad, how do we get the pirates off our shores?

173
00:08:57,560 --> 00:09:00,560
Do they have to be evicted then?

174
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:05,640
It is because they litter the beach and appoint me as a beach cleaner.

175
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:09,720
And they don't even look like real pirates?

176
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:12,800
The beach is ours and we want it back.

177
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:15,880
Oh your beach.

178
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:20,080
I doubt you're right about that, my boy.

179
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:22,160
How so?

180
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:26,240
For example, it feels good to take a nap in the sun,

181
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:28,320
but you can't own the sun.

182
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:32,400
It stays in the sky to everyone's delight, doesn't it?

183
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:36,480
In the same way, the beach is intended for everyone's use.

184
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:38,560
Yes, but...

185
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:44,640
So are we doing wrong in trying to evict them?

186
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:47,680
We got sweets and apples from them.

187
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:51,760
What are you talking about, Nipsu? Don't care what happens to the beach?

188
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:54,840
Because you can't swim and you can't fish.

189
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:58,920
If you and mummy don't drive them away, we will.

190
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Yeah, for sure.

191
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:04,080
Sniff, snuff, what do you say?

192
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:09,160
If someone tried to break my lip harp, I would defend it to the death.

193
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:14,240
I'm sure everyone has something important that they won't give up.

194
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:17,600
So we defend our own shore.

195
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:25,480
Mumipekko and Nipsu, quick.

196
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:28,560
Why do you need so many branches?

197
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:31,640
Don't ask me about it.

198
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:34,720
Wait, this time you're leaving.

199
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:40,720
What the hell is a little girl aiming for when she makes a campfire?

200
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:43,800
Ha, the sale is here.

201
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:45,880
Will it return? Burn.

202
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:49,960
But how does burning a campfire relate to chasing away pirates?

203
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:52,040
You'll find out soon, won't you?

204
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:55,120
What do you need so much seaweed for?

205
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:57,200
You'll see.

206
00:10:57,280 --> 00:11:00,280
The algae is really wet.

207
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:03,640
The algae is really wet.

208
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:06,720
Doubles, thick foul-smelling smoke.

209
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:13,360
And when the wind blows from the south, all the smoke goes into the pirates' mouths.

210
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:18,320
Aha, you're going to drive the pirates out of their way with smoke.

211
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:21,400
Yeah, dude, you're not the idiot.

212
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:24,480
That sudden note is all that burns.

213
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:28,480
Uuu, get up, get up, bucket, smoke.

214
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:33,560
You'll soon learn what it's like to be on the same beach with a little baby.

215
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:45,640
Hihihi.

216
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:48,720
Oops, the wind is changing direction.

217
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:51,800
Hey, come hang out.

218
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:57,160
I'm from there now.

219
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:59,240
Hey, let it go, let it go.

220
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:01,320
We have to give it a go.

221
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:03,400
We must.

222
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:06,480
Cool velli pants.

223
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:10,560
It doesn't matter where that smoke comes from.

224
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:12,640
Someone must be krill.

225
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:14,720
You are hot pants.

226
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:17,800
No one can suffer from smoke for that long.

227
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:19,880
Not so. It's true.

228
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:22,960
Yes, but the wind has changed direction again.

229
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:26,960
Re. I make a lot of smoke at work because of it.

230
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:30,040
I think the smoke is bad for me.

231
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:33,120
Nipsu, I guess you want to get the beach back?

232
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:35,200
Not right now.

233
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:38,280
Aite, the children are here.

234
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:40,360
Good day again.

235
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:42,440
Thanks for the goodies.

236
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:44,520
What are you doing there?

237
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:48,600
Since it's almost lunchtime, we thought we'd fry some fish.

238
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:51,680
Hoho, it happened at a good time.

239
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:54,680
I thought we would cook soon.

240
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:57,760
Can we come to the campfire together?

241
00:12:57,840 --> 00:13:00,840
Of course. Just be nice.

242
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:02,920
Yes, that's fine.

243
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Good. Hello, aite. To cook food.

244
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:09,080
Idiot, you ruined everything again.

245
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:11,160
Which one did I fit in?

246
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:16,240
Things on wheels. A real picnic.

247
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:19,320
The single stem looks ripe already.

248
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:22,360
Isn't it a treat? Poke your cheeks.

249
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:24,440
Yeah, yeah.

250
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:27,520
What's wrong with you kids?

251
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:29,600
Eat as much as you can.

252
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:31,680
You're not hungry at all.

253
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:34,760
If you have had too much sun.

254
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:36,840
Pity throws good food away.

255
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:38,920
Yeah, really.

256
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Ipsu!

257
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:43,080
That...

258
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:45,160
We remembered that we have work to do.

259
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:48,240
Do I have to do it right away? It's sad.

260
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:50,720
Yeah, yeah. Excuse me now.

261
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:52,800
I have nothing to do.

262
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:54,880
Ipsu, aren't you letting us down?

263
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:56,960
It wasn't meant to be.

264
00:13:57,040 --> 00:14:00,040
We have to go now and have some fun.

265
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:05,320
This is good. Eat this.

266
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:07,400
Do you offer?

267
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:09,480
We have a lot of grilled sausages.

268
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:13,560
Thanks. Ipsu, you want to come before I get mad.

269
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:20,240
Don't always dream of delicacies.

270
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:23,320
You know what we have to think about now?

271
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:25,400
Yeah, I know.

272
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:29,480
Maybe they're not the kind of people you can drive away.

273
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:34,560
We must hope for a gale or a whirlwind to help us.

274
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:37,640
A hurricane that after sucking is.

275
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:39,720
This is good.

276
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:41,800
This is good.

277
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:43,880
This is good.

278
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:45,960
This is good.

279
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:49,320
A hurricane that will suck them into its throat.

280
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:51,400
Where is the hurricane?

281
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:54,480
Tell me, I'll order it here.

282
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,560
Ipsu, in your head it's coming.

283
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:58,640
I was just kidding.

284
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:02,720
Ipsu, do what you do, but don't try to count the fun.

285
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:05,800
Hey, that's what got me thinking.

286
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:07,880
Now a way was found.

287
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:09,880
Now.

288
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:21,960
Jaha, you guys gave up, you're not trying to evict pirates from the beach anymore.

289
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:25,040
Are you tired of some trick?

290
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:27,120
Well, no.

291
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:30,200
You can see from your face that you haven't given up after all.

292
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:32,280
We're not!

293
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:35,360
Look at what we're building.

294
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:37,440
This cow predicts the weather.

295
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:39,800
Or like that?

296
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:44,880
Here comes the benefits.

297
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:47,960
Well, I guess you know how to read the Weather Bulletin.

298
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:51,040
Trust me admit, be careful.

299
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:54,120
Do pirates believe the weather forecast I sell?

300
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:56,200
Will you come to my place?

301
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:59,280
You should have your ears and legs cut off first.

302
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:01,360
Isn't it you or something?

303
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:03,440
I trust you now!

304
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:05,520
Is everything okay?

305
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:07,600
Don't wave!

306
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:09,680
Don't bounce there!

307
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:13,760
Don't stop! You don't like the nativity scene straight!

308
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:15,840
Sell, now you can start!

309
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:19,920
Don't fool around!

310
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,000
Don't interrupt me, I'm trying out my voice!

311
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:27,080
Don't wave, pirates can hear most of what you say.

312
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:30,160
Plimplomplomplum!

313
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:33,240
Emergency notification! Emergency notification!

314
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:36,280
Hat notice for people on the beach!

315
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:40,360
Let's get out of here now! A typhoon wind that is being approached by a mummy boat!

316
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:42,440
What?

317
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:46,520
The 40 foot high waves swept away the sand as well as the hikers!

318
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:49,600
Go either north or south!

319
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:52,680
I must say that cleverly invented.

320
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:56,760
From what I hear, shouldn't we tell those human holes,

321
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:58,840
that everything is just a joke?

322
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:01,920
I don't want people on our beach either.

323
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:04,120
Oh papa.

324
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:06,200
Lord time.

325
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:08,280
Kids, hurry to the boat.

326
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:12,360
Photo hikers have five minutes to collect their backpacks and leave.

327
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:14,440
Good invention.

328
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:18,520
So. They are in such a hurry they trip over their own feet.

329
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:20,600
Come on, have fun!

330
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:22,680
Nipsu, from you!

331
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:24,760
I support it too.

332
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:26,760
Come on!

333
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:34,320
Sky! The typhoon is indeed here!

334
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:38,400
I have supernatural powers! I can kill the wind!

335
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:50,480
Moomin-Pekka is selling, nipsu, are you breathing?

336
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:52,560
Au!

337
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:54,560
Get off me.

338
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:56,640
Anna, excuse me.

339
00:17:56,720 --> 00:18:00,720
You kids here again. What are you doing now?

340
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:02,800
We're just taking a walk.

341
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:04,880
On foot, yes.

342
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:06,960
Let me out!

343
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:14,720
Misery! This time we almost succeeded in driving them away.

344
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:16,800
To expel whom?

345
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:18,880
Well, who do you think you are?

346
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:20,960
Why?

347
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:22,960
Our! And we don't want you here.

348
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:25,040
Your beach?

349
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:27,120
So.

350
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:31,520
The rain finally came.

351
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:33,600
Is it possible for the boat to be properly closed?

352
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:35,680
Oh. Oh no.

353
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:39,280
Moomin-Pekko.

354
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:41,360
Mom and Dad, what are you doing there?

355
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:45,440
Don't ask. Come and help with securing the boat.

356
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:52,960
Oh! Oh!

357
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:55,040
Oh!

358
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:57,120
Oh!

359
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:59,200
Oh!

360
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:01,280
Oh!

361
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:03,360
Oh!

362
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:05,440
Oh!

363
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:07,520
Oh!

364
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:09,600
Oh!

365
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:11,680
Oh!

366
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:20,240
You were very helpful.

367
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:22,720
Just thank you.

368
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:24,800
You know how our life would have turned out if you weren't there.

369
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:26,880
Indeed. Many thanks to everyone.

370
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:28,960
If the truth be told, then...

371
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:31,040
It sounds like you guys really like the beach.

372
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:33,120
We should have asked permission to land.

373
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:35,200
Not when we should be apologizing.

374
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:37,280
We don't own the beach.

375
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:39,360
We could have played together.

376
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:41,440
You said it right.

377
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:43,520
Now can we have some hot tea?

378
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:45,600
Yes, please.

379
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:47,680
Thanks.

380
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:49,920
A hot cup is good after a typhoon.

381
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
You have a good weather service.

382
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:54,080
It's true.

383
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:56,160
You probably don't have a home because you're pirates.

384
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:58,240
What? I thought I was kidding then.

385
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:00,320
Or that way?

386
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:02,400
It seemed strange to us that pirates have children.

387
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:04,480
This is how we spend summer vacation.

388
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:06,560
Sailing around.

389
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:08,640
From here, we thought about reversals.

390
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:10,720
We have together.

391
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:12,800
We have together.

392
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:14,880
We have together.

393
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:16,960
We have together.

394
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:19,640
A couple of us decided to head south.

395
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:22,680
So?

396
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:29,960
Take this reward at random.

397
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:32,040
It's probably worth it.

398
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:34,120
You could get a good price for that.

399
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:36,200
A pinch!

400
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:38,680
It is the left eye of the salmon roll.

401
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:41,080
I got it as spoils of war in the China Sea.

402
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:43,160
Just like that.

403
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:46,120
Moomin, boss. Beware that ye transgress it.

404
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:50,120
Can you imagine a real salmon snake eye?

405
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:53,120
Don't believe everything he says.

406
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:56,120
It's just a crystal ball.

407
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:59,120
It's not from the China Sea.

408
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:07,120
Hi everyone then!

409
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:09,120
Too many of them!

410
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:12,120
I told you a trick!

411
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:14,120
Let's meet!

412
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:18,120
Hey!
