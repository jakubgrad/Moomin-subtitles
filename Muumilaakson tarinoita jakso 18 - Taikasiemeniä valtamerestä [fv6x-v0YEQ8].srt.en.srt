1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
It hadn't rained in Moomin Valley for weeks, and eventually the river dried up.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Dad said this is almost a disaster.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Uh, I guess not.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Well, ompa, Moominland is turning into a desert.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Moomin Falls is now turning into a desert.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Moomin Falls is now turning into a desert.

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Moomin Falls is now turning into a desert.

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Moomin Falls is now turning into a desert.

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I doubt it, it has been dry before.

10
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
There hasn't been a man to remember, something has dried up.

11
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
That's what I'm worried about. I can't fish anymore.

12
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:48,000
But I've noticed while traveling that dry times are always followed by wet weather.

13
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
At least for me, this air is too hot.

14
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Huh, it's so hot, you can't even think.

15
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I can always think.

16
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Oh dear, even the weeds are dying.

17
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
The sea will never dry up.

18
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Tampeli, where would the fish go?

19
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I'm going swimming.

20
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Oh, I got dressed.

21
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Let's look at it.

22
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Let's look at it.

23
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Let's look at it.

24
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Let's look at it.

25
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Let's look at it.

26
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Let's look at it.

27
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Let's look at it.

28
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Let's look at it.

29
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Let's look at it.

30
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Let's look at it.

31
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Let's look at it.

32
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Let's look at it.

33
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,000
What's that stupid box doing here?

34
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,000
It's always from somewhere far away.

35
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Naur gets totta ja kiva.

36
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Select your menu item.

37
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Hi, he stayed so picsyn reik materiara.

38
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
What is it, a treasure chest?

39
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Hardly a hit lady, it's not heavy enough for a treasure chest.

40
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Let's open it.

41
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Will you push the box ashore? Hey speed up!

42
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
I think it has jewelry.

43
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Just not fruit.

44
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
What are they?

45
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Seeds maybe.

46
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
What seeds?

47
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
I've never seen seeds like that.

48
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,000
I would say tropical plant seeds.

49
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Really?

50
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
But what seeds?

51
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Even a banana or a mango.

52
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
A banana?

53
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Mango seeds.

54
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Well, yeah, I haven't studied tropical tumors enough to be sure.

55
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Mother, let's plant the seeds.

56
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
That's a good idea.

57
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,000
However, nothing grows from the seeds.

58
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
This is not a tropical climate.

59
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
I'm not so sure about that.

60
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:55,000
They may sprout, but that's about it.

61
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,000
This climate seems very tropical to me.

62
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
You can always try it.

63
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
I want to see what papaya looks like.

64
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:07,000
I want banana and mango to grow under my window.

65
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Let's start planting.

66
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Banana and mango are tropical or subtropical plants.

67
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Mamma seems to be full of enthusiasm.

68
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
No fuss.

69
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Maybe, but trying something new is always exciting.

70
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Moomilaakso turns into a jungle.

71
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Hey, Hemuli!

72
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Hemuli, would these seeds grow into fruit trees?

73
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Joo.

74
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,000
I'm not sure, little one.

75
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,000
I think this is a mango.

76
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Well, thanks.

77
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Why do you necessarily want to know?

78
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Because I'm planting a secret garden.

79
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:19,000
And I don't want anything stupid to grow there, orchids, but mango.

80
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Hemuli, what is a banana seed?

81
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
I'm not quite sure, but I thought it was this one.

82
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Are you also planting an orchard?

83
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:37,000
I don't. I just want to plant a banana tree in the best place.

84
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Banana is Moomin's favorite fruit.

85
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:47,000
There is no way a banana tree grows this far in the north.

86
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Hey, is this air some kind of air from the north?

87
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:55,000
I can hardly wait for the sunset to cool off a bit.

88
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,000
It's wonderful to wait for sleep while looking at the stars.

89
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
And it's not so hot anymore.

90
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,000
I'll sleep like a log tonight.

91
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Don't you always sleep like a log?

92
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Tonight I sleep like a heavy log.

93
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Well, my dear, why don't you sleep with the others under the tree?

94
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Well, because you can't see the stars from there.

95
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,000
The stars twinkled so beautifully.

96
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:37,000
You'll get absolutely soaked if it starts to rain.

97
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Mom, are you kidding me?

98
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
I really don't.

99
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,000
It hasn't rained in weeks.

100
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
The sky is full of clouds.

101
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Yes, but the toothpicks fell on the floor and it predicts rain.

102
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Mamma, the wet lady doesn't care, even if you get soaked through.

103
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Oh why not?

104
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Well, no, because if it rains, his Tree will start to grow.

105
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
That's true.

106
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Good night everyone.

107
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
I'm sleepy.

108
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
I'm sleepy.

109
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Good night.

110
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Don't snore at home.

111
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Oh, it's too hot.

112
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Why don't you go out and sleep?

113
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Yeah, why not, to the hammock.

114
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Thunder!

115
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,000
It's raining, toothpicks know.

116
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Hello hundred, my orchard.

117
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Moomin little one, wake up.

118
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Is it morning?

119
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
The sun dazzled.

120
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
No, it's raining now.

121
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Rain?

122
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Just look?

123
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
When you look at it.

124
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
I don't want to get wet.

125
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
What a wonderful rain.

126
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Wake up, wake up.

127
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,000
I don't want to get wet.

128
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
I don't want to get wet.

129
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Wake up, wake up.

130
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Sleeps like a princess.

131
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Wake-up!

132
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Is it raining?

133
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Well, reel attention.

134
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Mamma really knows a thing or two.

135
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,000
You know. Let's go inside.

136
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Not yet. I want to feel the rain falling on me.

137
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Someone, you've had enough of the rain.

138
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Thanks.

139
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Is he a rain chicken?

140
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
These are mangoes.

141
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Out.

142
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Through my tail.

143
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Jungle, jungle.

144
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Get up.

145
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Get up.

146
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
It's a jungle here.

147
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
We live in a jungle.

148
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
In the jungle.

149
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
In the jungle.

150
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Are you trying to claim that the seeds have already germinated?

151
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Big trees have grown from them.

152
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
That's remarkable.

153
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:55,000
I'm going to the jungle to play tarzan.

154
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,000
My lettuce would grow just as well.

155
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
There is magic here.

156
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Let's go explore.

157
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
The water is gurgling in the stream again.

158
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Weird.

159
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Get up, little one.

160
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
What has happened?

161
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:30,000
We sowed tropical plant seeds in the evening and a jungle grew out of them overnight.

162
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
The seeds must have been bewitched.

163
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
It looks amazing.

164
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Shall we go on a safari in the jungle?

165
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Never seen before.

166
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
What flower is that?

167
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
It looks like an orchid to me.

168
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:52,000
We have a real jungle here now.

169
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Not exactly.

170
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
How so?

171
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Well, in a real jungle there must also be wild animals.

172
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Lions and elephants, of course.

173
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Our jungle is a tropical botanical garden.

174
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
They are for Moomin.

175
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
He gets killed.

176
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Stop it.

177
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Don't mess around.

178
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
what you

179
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Well where is it now?

180
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
What are you looking for?

181
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
My helmet.

182
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Sorry what?

183
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Heat on my helmet. I need you in the jungle.

184
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Do we have one?

185
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:47,000
I wore it to a masquerade once and I know I put it in one box.

186
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Here it is.

187
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
You look brisk.

188
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
That's the purpose.

189
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
God forbid.

190
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Oh!

191
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:14,000
The helmet is a great invention.

192
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Father.

193
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
What the hell are you doing?

194
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
I want to get to the basement.

195
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
For what?

196
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
To get my gun.

197
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Only fools wander into the jungle without a gun.

198
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:36,000
I don't think you need a gun.

199
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
And why?

200
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Because there are no wild animals.

201
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:43,000
There might even be an egg among the seeds.

202
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,000
They look animalistic too.

203
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
It's a strange animal.

204
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:56,000
I would rather say that there is a strange plant in it.

205
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
They have eyes.

206
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Probably a carnivorous plant.

207
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
A carnivore.

208
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Help! Stop helping!

209
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
They're trying to eat me!

210
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Stay strong longer!

211
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
No!

212
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:28,000
They were cutting my tail off!

213
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Thank you, Pikkumyy. You saved my life.

214
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,000
At least I saved your tail.

215
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
Hello! Hello!

216
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Get something sturdy for the door!

217
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Hurry up!

218
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
Whoa! Make it work!

219
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
Will they get through this?

220
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
They are not that strong.

221
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:21,000
You don't know that. They gripped him impossibly hard.

222
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
Is something wrong?

223
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Hear it!

224
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:28,000
The basement is full of meat and plants that are trying to make mummipapa hot!

225
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Oh horrible!

226
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
What now?

227
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,000
The basement leads directly to the kitchen.

228
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Save mommy!

229
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
Oh!

230
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
That was spot on, Dad.

231
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:50,000
What the hell have you come up with?

232
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
We do nothing.

233
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,000
By the way, try grandma's recipe right now,

234
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:58,000
if you know how to get a tropical fruit.

235
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Wake up.

236
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,000
By the way, try grandma's recipe right now,

237
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:08,000
if you know how to get a tropical fruit.

238
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:12,000
I don't think this is a tropical rain forest.

239
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:18,000
Transkendentia megaloides.

240
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,000
I dyspepsia floribunda.

241
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:25,000
I can gather tropical flora from here in mummy valley.

242
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
I estimate the garden spade.

243
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Borrow from Grandma.

244
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:36,000
I must say that this family does not care about the broth order.

245
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Ha ha ha.

246
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
Do I look funny?

247
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
Viirakonkoninga weather.

248
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,000
Tartsan has plumper muscles.

249
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:14,000
Tartsan loves Jane.

250
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,000
I'm disappearing.

251
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:20,000
Before I start attacking.

252
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Ai!

253
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Help! Muscles are growing on my heels.

254
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:28,000
What? Have there been more?

255
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
Oh!

256
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,000
They were in the basement.

257
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
Did you open the door?

258
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:50,000
I opened. I was going to borrow a shovel.

259
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,000
Listen Hemuli, since you know everything about plants,

260
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:57,000
maybe you also know how to get rid of carnivorous plants.

261
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:01,000
A botanist does not try to get rid of rarities,

262
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:05,000
but hearing music affects them.

263
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
Music?

264
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:10,000
Calling down, Nuuska Muikkunen.

265
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,000
They started dancing.

266
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:16,000
Call, Nuuska Muikkunen.

267
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,000
What if Nuuska Muikkunen quits?

268
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:46,000
I just don't know.

269
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:54,000
What's going on here?

270
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:14,000
They are even attractive when they are not in a bundle.

271
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:20,000
Just like that, a jungle grew up around the Moomin house overnight.

272
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:24,000
Does the jungle ask and what carnivorous plants do,

273
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:28,000
if Nuuska Muikkunen stops playing?
