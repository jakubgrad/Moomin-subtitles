1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,000
The snow cover strengthened during the day. It was high time for the Moomins to hibernate.

2
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
what are you doing

3
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Alisa!

4
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Why do you collect needles?

5
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
We eat them every year before we hibernate.

6
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Are you going to hibernate now?

7
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Tonight.

8
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Already now?

9
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Joo.

10
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000
I was lucky. If I had come tomorrow you would have slept.

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
You knew how to come appropriately.

12
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:59,000
We usually keep the small cookies the night we retire to hibernation.

13
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Moomin, can I have some cookies?

14
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Do you know those by the way? Oh, forgive your granny for coming to Moominvalley.

15
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
In my opinion, adults don't need to know everything.

16
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
You are right.

17
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Grandma doesn't really like me coming to you.

18
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
And why not?

19
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:25,000
I guess he's afraid that I'll have more fun playing here than studying the witch's subjects.

20
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Aren't you a witch yet?

21
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Well, I don't. Today, it requires seven years of study.

22
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Are you sure you want to be a witch?

23
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Study something else.

24
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
I'm going to be a witch.

25
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Yeah, but look, witches aren't always popular.

26
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Don't they? I will be popular with everyone.

27
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Are you going to join us?

28
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
I'm going.

29
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,000
I thought you'd already wandered south.

30
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
I promised the Moomin troll.

31
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
You promised what?

32
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Well, I won't leave until he hibernates.

33
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Full representation.

34
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
And one extra.

35
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Cry?

36
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Well Guess.

37
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Ah, the witch's daughter's daughter, of course.

38
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Ah, guessed right.

39
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
O-was it?

40
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
But you must have been sneaking around corners and such, Alisa.

41
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Well, no, it was just a guess, believe me.

42
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Alisa wanted to come and greet us.

43
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Father shows him the house.

44
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Are there any here?

45
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
No, why would you?

46
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
It's good, really good.

47
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Hello, little snuff, I'm finally here.

48
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Hi, this is Nipsu.

49
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Do you remember him?

50
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Of course, hi Nipsu.

51
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Hey, Rooster, Luuru, listen.

52
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Didn't she just bewitch me?

53
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
In.

54
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Moomins didn't just eat needles.

55
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Moomin mamma had prepared a lot of different delicacies.

56
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,000
I apologize to you.

57
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Why?

58
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:27,000
You decided to postpone your departure because of my selfishness.

59
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
I'm leaving tomorrow.

60
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
The snow is thick.

61
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:37,000
It's okay, I'm used to the snow, but it might be hard for Alisa to get home.

62
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:42,000
He could sleep with us, but when we no longer wake up in the morning.

63
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Someone is at the door.

64
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
I'll go see.

65
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Good evening.

66
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Evening, evening.

67
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
I guess he's here, huh?

68
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Who the hell is there?

69
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Hi, hi, hi.

70
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
You must be Moomin papa.

71
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Now listen, Papa Moomin.

72
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:22,000
I absolutely do not want my daughter's daughter to come here to play with your children.

73
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Alisa enjoys being with us.

74
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Grandma.

75
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
We're going home.

76
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Can't I stay yet?

77
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Join us at the dinner table.

78
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:35,000
I'm a Witch, I can't eat your baby butt.

79
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Alisa's food was good.

80
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:41,000
It's because she's not a Witch yet. Come on, Alice.

81
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Go ahead of you.

82
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Not at all, miss. Witches don't associate with people like this.

83
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Nor do you try Witches.

84
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Why? They are nice.

85
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,000
That's the fault. They are incredibly kind.

86
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Let's continue this topic at home.

87
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Come now.

88
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:09,000
More snow has fallen and the frost is getting tougher.

89
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Well, I'll come then.

90
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Thank you, Moomin papa.

91
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Whence?

92
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
At least we understand each other.

93
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
I don't think so.

94
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Well, that's it, but without further ado.

95
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Don't ever talk to Alisa again. Is it clear?

96
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
But grandma.

97
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:34,000
If you disobey me, the vengeance of Osiris will fall upon you.

98
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Cheap threats don't work for Moomin Pappa.

99
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,000
You are mistaken if you imagine that your Antics scare us.

100
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,000
I have three diplomas.

101
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Anyway, how are you even going to get home with Alisa in this snow?

102
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Pih, a child's job for Noida. Come on Alice.

103
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Have you ever seen the Hiulu people on a broom here before?

104
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Right Witch's broom huh? Does it fly?

105
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Let's get closer.

106
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Come on Alisa, hop on board.

107
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Joo.

108
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Looks like a bone to you both?

109
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Well, hardly, the broom looks pretty flimsy.

110
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Don't freak out in this weather.

111
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Alisa, be careful not to fall.

112
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:29,000
You're horrible liars, shut up already.

113
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Are you ready?

114
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
I am.

115
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
They are guaranteed to take off.

116
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Tel.

117
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Broom the pipe.

118
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Eight.

119
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
I guessed they are too heavy.

120
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:13,000
I could take Alisa's place. I don't weigh that much.

121
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Grandma, I'm walking home.

122
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Don't talk crazy, you'll sink into the snow if you walk into the forest.

123
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
I wish I had skis.

124
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,000
You start coming, I'll try again.

125
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Grandma, does the audience make you nervous?

126
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Shut up, help me.

127
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
God's concoction.

128
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Let's go.

129
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Goodbye Moomin, Goblin, goodbye everyone.

130
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Grandma, don't.

131
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:28,000
A skilled witch despite three diplomas.

132
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,000
They would come down so I could get on board too.

133
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Let's go back to the table. Food is waiting.

134
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Oh dear, I didn't remember to thank you for the dinner invitation.

135
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:52,000
I don't think you're the right witch.

136
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,000
But I want to become a witch.

137
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:59,000
I know and I will help you, but the road will be bumpy.

138
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Oh grandma!

139
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Musakamoikkunen

140
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,000
When the underlings had flown their way and the Moomins had gone to rest for the winter,

141
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Nuska Muikkunen started to wander south.

142
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:03,000
The Moomin would probably have slept until spring,

143
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:08,000
unless something unexpected happened.

144
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Since after Nuska Muikkunen

145
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:19,000
they would probably have slept their spring.

146
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Since after Nuska Muikkunen

147
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:29,000
they would probably have slept their spring.

148
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Since after Nuska Muikkunen

149
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:39,000
they would probably have slept their spring.

150
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Since after Nuska Muikkunen

151
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Someone is spring.

152
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,000
There is someone behind the window.

153
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Frame frozen shut.

154
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Hey, why did you wake me up?

155
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:39,000
You can't sleep. Christmas is coming.

156
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Not a moment must be wasted.

157
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Or is Christmas coming? Who is Christmas?

158
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,000
What? You can have time for banter,

159
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,000
but i don't have. Nothing is ready.

160
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Everyone was hooting and hollering.

161
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Christmas is almost here and I still don't have a moon.

162
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
From the moon?

163
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Hey, wait!

164
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Wait!

165
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
What today?

166
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Christmas is coming and we have no moon.

167
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Protect!

168
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Christmas is coming.

169
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Yes, and there are still six more to apply for.

170
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
What do you need the moon for?

171
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Maybe the moon is needed as some kind of protection against Christmas.

172
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
That thing didn't become clear.

173
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,000
It is some horror that must be avoided.

174
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,000
I'm going to go find a spruce right away.

175
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,000
It was also time to lift up.

176
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Good day, Kampsu.

177
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Let your trees grow old.

178
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Thanks.

179
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:10,000
May I ask what the moon is used for?

180
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Well, but you can make fun of granny priests to their face.

181
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Joking?

182
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Sorry, I still have Christmas food to cook.

183
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Or was I making fun of a familiar story?

184
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Uh.

185
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Would you like some more?

186
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:40,000
No thanks. I'm warm and good to be again.

187
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:44,000
I saw granny papa and granny elf money, but a big month.

188
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
But what to do with the spruce?

189
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Don't you know?

190
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Emme.

191
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
It must be dressed as beautifully as possible.

192
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Just like that.

193
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Thanks for the tea, it was delicious.

194
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
Are you leaving?

195
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Yeah, I have a long way to go.

196
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Have a nice trip.

197
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Good day.

198
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Goodbye.

199
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Goodbye.

200
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Who was that?

201
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Someone who was very busy before Christmas came.

202
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
I gave him tea.

203
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
That was nice.

204
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
He advised us what to do with the fir tree.

205
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
So what?

206
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Six are dressed up beautifully.

207
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,000
Why? Why do you have to wear it?

208
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:46,000
I think Christmas has to be softened somehow.

209
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Yes.

210
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Let's start dressing right away.

211
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Yeah, we're going to be busy.

212
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Joo.

213
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Oh, mom.

214
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
What honey?

215
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:59,000
I hear you have to prepare a lot of food for Christmas.

216
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:02,000
May I be protected. So that Christmas doesn't eat us.

217
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Here.

218
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Thank you, my mother.

219
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Oh, the ship has a sense of value to me.

220
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:20,000
It looks great on the tree.

221
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Really handsome.

222
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Oh.

223
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Hey, put this on top.

224
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
Mother's still rose.

225
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Don't mourn.

226
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Mom doesn't need decorations.

227
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Hey, listen.

228
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:49,000
I just heard that for Christmas you also need gifts.

229
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Nope.

230
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
Nope.

231
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:56,000
What does Christmas look like?

232
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:00,000
If it's an ugly monster, like a moron.

233
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Don't be afraid.

234
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:05,000
We give gifts and plenty of food for Christmas.

235
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
Have you come up with a present for Christmas?

236
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
I don't. is that you

237
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,000
I give this.

238
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
A beautiful shoe.

239
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Mom, look what I'm giving you for Christmas.

240
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,000
A handsome lure, although bad at fishing.

241
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
I'll give you a picture book.

242
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Great. Christmas will certainly be happy and will not harm us.

243
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Christmas can come at any moment, whatever.

244
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
I guess so.

245
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:52,000
I hope Christmas likes pumpkin pie.

246
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
I'm sure it will.

247
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Every creature trembles and waits for Christmas.

248
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
So.

249
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
Are you dreaming?

250
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:13,000
Dreaming. I can't be afraid of Christmas anymore.

251
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Christmas should come before all the food freezes.

252
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Christmas is coming.

253
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Who would have thought that Christmas is so small?

254
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Have a great Christmas.

255
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Do you think Christmas is fun?

256
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Well, it's usually welcome.

257
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:39,000
All my life I've dreamed of seeing this up close.

258
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
A wonderfully beautiful fir tree.

259
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,000
I brought my little friend with me to watch.

260
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Welcome, everyone.

261
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,000
Thank you. Did you hear what Moominpa said?

262
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
How much food.

263
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:04,000
It's all for Christmas.

264
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
And are they gifts?

265
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,000
They are.

266
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:12,000
Gifts have always fascinated me somehow.

267
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,000
Dad, I don't think they are Christmas.

268
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
Me neither.

269
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
Mom, you seem sleepy.

270
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
I am too.

271
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:24,000
It's already well past midnight.

272
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Where is it Christmas?

273
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,000
Aren't you sleepy?

274
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:33,000
Oh no, who could sleep next to such a beautiful tree?

275
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,000
Dad.

276
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,000
What?

277
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:40,000
Do you think the same as me?

278
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,000
I'm just together.

279
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:47,000
Not even Christmas is angry this late at night.

280
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:50,000
Let's close the doors and go to safety.

281
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
Let's do that.

282
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:56,000
New foods and gifts are all yours.

283
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:00,000
What? All of them? All?

284
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,000
Right.

285
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:05,000
We are so sleepy that we go to sleep.

286
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
I'm together.

287
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
I'm together.

288
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
I'm together.

289
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,000
I'm together.

290
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
I'm together.

291
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:21,000
Yes, there must be one for the night when Capturen is closed.

292
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:25,300
Kas scales

293
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
Which and also varriage

294
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:36,000
it's just to show the implementation of the kokoorder Wissen

295
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
Do not!

296
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,000
I thought there should be a star on the top of the Christmas tree.

297
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:50,000
Is there much of a difference? The silk rose is very, very beautiful.

298
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
You look over there!

299
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
Oh!

300
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:20,000
The Moomins slept peacefully all night, and Christmas did not attack them.

301
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:24,000
I guess it went somewhere else?
