1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Are you sure you can get along now?

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Don't worry, honey.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Be careful with fire.

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Mommy, you already said that.

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
The jam is on the shelf in a familiar place.

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
You already said that.

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Oh, did I say.

8
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
And then wash the sheets and clean the dump every day and...

9
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Not every day now and remember...

10
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Now we have to try to try to try to try to try to try.

11
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Not every day now and remember...

12
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Now we have to hurry so we won't be late for the wedding ceremony.

13
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
We have to pass over lonely mountains.

14
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Oh yes, so true.

15
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Take care of yourselves.

16
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
We will be back as soon as possible.

17
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
After all, I can count on you with a nod and a snot.

18
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Celebrate in peace.

19
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Try to take good care of yourself.

20
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Remember the coming-of-age party!

21
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Don't forget me!

22
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
You get nothing!

23
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
On what basis?

24
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Fear not, I have something for everyone.

25
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Well, here we go.

26
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Have a nice trip!

27
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Keep the sharks in the sharks!

28
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Thank you, thank you.

29
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Hey hey!

30
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Bye!

31
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I can eat these.

32
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
When you eat what's on the table.

33
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
That's where we start with the house spekky kids!

34
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Let's think that we are the hosts of the house.

35
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Yes, oh I want to sleep outside among the cooks.

36
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Hi, may I make a suggestion?

37
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Let's go to the river to swim logs.

38
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Right now, right?

39
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Let's go!

40
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
I'll come along!

41
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Hey hey!

42
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
I can when I can't swim.

43
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Nipsu, don't always marise!

44
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
It's hard for me to keep my balance!

45
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Nipsu, don't spin the log!

46
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Hey, it's dangerous to stand!

47
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Go sit down!

48
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Nipsu, stay tuned for that!

49
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Nothing will come of this!

50
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Their back paws are like macaroni!

51
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Nipsu, you must not rotate!

52
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Hey!

53
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Hey!

54
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Hey!

55
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Hey!

56
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Hooray! Where did you all go!

57
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Moomin!

58
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Miss Niisko!

59
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Jahuku! Jahuku!

60
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Please help!

61
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Nipsu, don't mess it up! It's low here!

62
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
True! The ice reaches the bottom!

63
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Hey kids! What are you doing?

64
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Sorry we!

65
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Get out of the water right away!

66
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
The river is too dangerous a playground!

67
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
You're still drowning!

68
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
He looks like a hemule!

69
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I don't know!

70
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
May I ask who the aunt is?

71
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
It's none of your business!

72
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Get out of the water now and mess up kids!

73
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

74
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
South!

75
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Who the heck is that old coot?

76
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
You guys scared me!

77
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Remember, that was the last time you make judgments!

78
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
The river, there are dangers, it is very shallow!

79
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
All rivers are dangerous!

80
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Think what would have happened if I hadn't missed it!

81
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
We would play in peace!

82
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
That's right!

83
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Mom would agree with me,

84
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
if he were here!

85
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
We lean on our backs to support the land,

86
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
and we've never had anything happen to us!

87
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
You have been lucky!

88
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Don't I'm a snotty young man!

89
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Even if you haven't been in an accident yet,

90
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
it didn't seem to be included!

91
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,300
Now you can welcome me to your home.

92
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:46,000
Is it clear?

93
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,500
That's where your home is.

94
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:55,500
Talk to mom.

95
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:58,500
Mom and Dad aren't at home!

96
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
I mean...

97
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Is innate?

98
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Saatio, what do you have to do at the disco?

99
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,500
Hey ole biisi relationsiÿ Deadpool.

100
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:11,500
We are not at home.

101
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:13,500
Oh, when are they coming back?

102
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:15,500
Not for a long time yet.

103
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:16,500
Or so.

104
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:21,500
Mom and dad went to our relative's wedding on the other side of those mountains.

105
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:23,500
Oh, good unusual.

106
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:27,500
And you'll be on your own until they come back.

107
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:30,500
Hello ma'am. We know how to take care of ourselves.

108
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:32,500
Well, he sure can.

109
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:36,500
Your parents are thoughtless, downright irresponsible.

110
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:40,500
You mustn't talk bad about mom and dad.

111
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:42,500
Not so! And who is the lady?

112
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:46,500
Ugh. And I'm not a lady to you.

113
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:48,500
Call me Hemulitäri.

114
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:51,500
Hemuli who lives here is my brother.

115
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:02,500
Oh, my goodness, what a mess.

116
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:06,500
This if mika proves, you can't survive alone.

117
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:10,500
Moominmamma and Moominpapa won't be back for a long time.

118
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:13,500
Absolutely. I'll take care of you.

119
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:15,500
Wake up.

120
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:18,500
Now comes another one for the sound clock.

121
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:22,500
Let's start cleaning. Here are rags.

122
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:24,500
Too much.

123
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:28,500
Not ma'am, but Aunt Hemulitä. what is your name

124
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:31,500
I am Moomin, Moomin Goblin.

125
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:35,500
Didn't the aunt mean to go to Hemul?

126
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:38,500
Yeah, yeah. Hemuli is already waiting for aunt.

127
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:40,500
Oh, no problem.

128
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:42,500
My brother doesn't know I'm coming.

129
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:46,500
And I wouldn't be able to bless it with peace because I would think only of you.

130
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:53,500
I could be so irresponsible that I would leave the little helpless children at home for days.

131
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:55,500
Aunty is talking ugly again.

132
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:57,500
That's what he says.

133
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:59,500
Did you say something? I don't.

134
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:01,500
I'm starving.

135
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:05,500
The food will be ready soon. So when Eiti helps her aunt.

136
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:09,500
I bet the food is bad.

137
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:19,500
Wake up.

138
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:23,500
What's on your ankle?

139
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:26,500
What's on your ankle?

140
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:29,500
Ah, the anklet.

141
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:31,500
It's not appropriate.

142
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:36,500
Little girls don't wear anklets.

143
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:41,500
As an adult, you are free to make yourself a laughing stock.

144
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:43,500
Yes, but...

145
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:45,500
I think the anklet is beautiful.

146
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:48,500
Oh, you must be a snob.

147
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:57,500
Your clothes need to be mended.

148
00:06:57,500 --> 00:07:00,500
Somehow they have never been ironed.

149
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:08,500
I thought we might have been apart.

150
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:10,500
Now we are climbing.

151
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:14,500
Moominmamma and Moominpapali are much nicer.

152
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:19,500
I'm sorry, but I'm leaving now.

153
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:22,500
Oh, don't leave just yet, you snob.

154
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:23,500
Don't be upset.

155
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:26,500
I can't stand that hideous hemuli aunt.

156
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:28,500
Well, the soup is ready.

157
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:30,500
Looks tasty.

158
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:32,500
Is the table set, Moomin?

159
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:35,500
There is. A snotty nose.

160
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:39,500
Nus cam Ichinomiya year.

161
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:43,500
Nuskamuikkunen left because he saw what kind of mess was coming.

162
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:47,500
Come on, sit down at the table and taste the soup.

163
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:48,500
Joo.

164
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:50,500
One is gone.

165
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:53,500
Nuskamuikkunen ran away.

166
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:54,500
Myy.

167
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:59,500
Listen, Myy, it's not appropriate for little girls like that to talk with their hands in a gust.

168
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:04,500
Where does the snowman live?

169
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:06,500
In a tent by the river.

170
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:12,500
In a tent? Well then I have to get him some soup.

171
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:15,500
Uh, that, but...

172
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:18,500
Eat now before it gets cold.

173
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:23,500
Moominma's soup looks tastier.

174
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:25,500
Guess it tastes awful.

175
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:27,500
Myy.

176
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:30,500
I know I'm a good cook.

177
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:32,500
Have a taste, now please.

178
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:34,500
Thank you, beautiful.

179
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:45,500
Better than the new ones.

180
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:50,500
It tastes just as delicious as Moominmamma's soup.

181
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:53,500
I didn't guess, wasn't it good?

182
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:55,500
You can get a pinch more if you want.

183
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:56,500
Do you like it, Myy?

184
00:08:56,500 --> 00:09:00,500
Probably a treat for someone who lacks a sense of taste.

185
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:03,500
That's right...

186
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:05,500
Ouch! Why you pipe me?

187
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:07,500
The giant should go away.

188
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:13,500
Well, this is no match for mother's soup.

189
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:15,500
Just like that.

190
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:18,500
But I think this is really good.

191
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:21,500
Do you think so?

192
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:22,500
I am.

193
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:26,500
It's funny to hear that there isn't anything really good for breakfast tomorrow either.

194
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:28,500
I want more.

195
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:29,500
It fits.

196
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:31,500
Nipsu is a real piggy bank.

197
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:34,500
Now this road ends at a corner.

198
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:37,500
Terribly hungry.

199
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:41,500
Sell, don't fight.

200
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:43,500
Do not eat food.

201
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:47,500
Nipsu must not poke around when it is in the spoon's mouth.

202
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:50,500
Moomintroll can't make a sound.

203
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:52,500
Sell, top ends off the table.

204
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:54,500
Ma'am, can I have more?

205
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:57,500
Don't call me ma'am, you're welcome.

206
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:13,500
The stars twinkled.

207
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:15,500
Muaska muikünen.

208
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:17,500
They create their light.

209
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:19,500
There you are.

210
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:20,500
Aunt Hemuli.

211
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:22,500
I brought you some soup.

212
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:24,500
Aunt is kind.

213
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:29,500
You really live in a tent.

214
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:30,500
That's how I live.

215
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:35,500
Isn't living in a tent unhealthy in the long run?

216
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:37,500
Muaska muikünen.

217
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:38,500
Hey.

218
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:40,500
Did you come over for the night?

219
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:41,500
If it works.

220
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:45,500
The soup was good, but I can't stand my aunt's nagging.

221
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:08,500
In the north I saw that huge whale.

222
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:09,500
Moi.

223
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:11,500
So what?

224
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:15,500
Then I went to the deer mountains and there I met the magician.

225
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:17,500
Nope.

226
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:24,500
They're still watching.

227
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:26,500
Tell me what you did then.

228
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:28,500
Well then...

229
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:32,500
I spent the night in an old dilapidated castle.

230
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:35,500
And how are you in the middle of the night?

231
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:38,500
How late did you stay up?

232
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:42,500
You should have been asleep a while ago.

233
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:44,500
We immediately go to sleep.

234
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:45,500
Moomin.

235
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:47,500
I close my eyes too.

236
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:48,500
Good.

237
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:52,500
Like that.

238
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:01,500
I want to hear the end of that story.

239
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:04,500
If we speak in whispers, my aunt probably won't hear downstairs.

240
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:07,500
Now. What did you see there in the castle?

241
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:08,500
I listened.

242
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:14,500
The heavy door opened with a creak and the old king came out wearing a crown.

243
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:17,500
But he was just a skeleton.

244
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:19,500
Do not.

245
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:33,500
Niskuneiti, you have to press a lot harder to get the dirt off.

246
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:34,500
Ai.

247
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:38,500
Little sister, you're just brushing the floor with a brush.

248
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:40,500
Oh, right?

249
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:43,500
Broom here. Use the brush like this.

250
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:46,500
Aaah, let it go well tonight.

251
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:50,500
Are you learning?

252
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:53,500
Auntie can clean when she can do it so well.

253
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:56,500
Make fun of the smaller mouth, young woman.

254
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:58,500
Yes, aunty.

255
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:09,500
Don't land on the grass.

256
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:13,500
The grass swarms with disgusting insects and worms.

257
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:15,500
Yes you are difficult.

258
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:17,500
What's wrong now?

259
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:21,500
Wash yourselves well before you enter.

260
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:27,500
When will mummy and daddy come home?

261
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:30,500
At least they don't have time for this trouble.

262
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:33,500
Are you saying that we have to continue with the old model?

263
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:35,500
I don't understand aunt.

264
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:37,500
We have to drive Auntie away!

265
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:39,500
But by what means?

266
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:45,500
I hope that the sea will come here and scare the aunt on its way.

267
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:49,500
Aunty would scare the crap out of me, and that would be it.

268
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:51,500
I guess so.

269
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:53,500
Would a poison ivy help?

270
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:03,500
Mmm, what a lovely scent.

271
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:08,500
Aunty, I have something to do.

272
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:11,500
Miss Niiskunne, you came just in time.

273
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:13,500
Taste these cookies.

274
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:15,500
Uh, yeah.

275
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:18,500
Ooh, good.

276
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:21,500
Unko, I'm happy.

277
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:23,500
Well how can I help?

278
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:25,500
Well, only when...

279
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:27,500
Bogey.

280
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:30,500
Aah! Hi muli aunty.

281
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:35,500
Did aunt scare the crap out of you?

282
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:38,500
Ms. Niiskun, please start mentioning the name of that object.

283
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:40,500
It won't be a bad thing, I'm afraid.

284
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:43,500
Really? That's great.

285
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:48,500
Jehu, now found a way. Soon we will be free.

286
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:51,500
The Needle stung me again.

287
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:53,500
How can you do it?

288
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:59,500
Now.

289
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:15,500
Bogey!

290
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:26,500
Dude, help! Help!

291
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:33,500
We succeeded! Aunt was scared.

292
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:36,500
Auntie is really afraid of the dark.

293
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:39,500
What a thud came from inside.

294
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:49,500
I will never forget this incident.

295
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:52,500
Tomorrow aunt will already be gone.

296
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:56,500
You know, even if he goes to the foot hill already tonight.

297
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:59,500
Did you notice the look on my face?

298
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:04,500
Oh, that's what it was all about.

299
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:10,500
I guess you don't like me.

300
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:14,500
I'm going to shoot tomorrow as soon as I wake up at my brother's.

301
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:19,500
I didn't stay here long, but I must say I enjoyed it.

302
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:21,500
Thanks.

303
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:42,500
I'm hungry.

304
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:46,500
It's your own fault that you didn't eat the soup I cooked.

305
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:50,500
Oh, that Aunt Himulitadi's soup was delicious.

306
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:53,500
Sopp and sopp, who cares about sopp?

307
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:55,500
Now we can do what we want.

308
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:59,500
And I can keep my hands busy for the rest of my life.

309
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:03,500
It's not very feminine to hold your hands in a gust.

310
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:06,500
I can keep my hands in a gust.

311
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:10,500
It's not very feminine to hold your hands in a gust.

312
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:13,500
For mouth soup, you're making soup yourself.

313
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:16,500
Nuska muikkun, Are you going to leave?

314
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:18,500
Eat fish well today.

315
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:22,500
I'll come along. It has rained so much now that we will probably catch a lot of fish.

316
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:24,500
Come on then.

317
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:27,500
Yeah, I'll come too.

318
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:29,500
Please wait for me.

319
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:32,500
Hey, now they leave me here alone.

320
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:37,500
Even if that same me goes fishing with him.

321
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:42,500
Sell, why not luck?

322
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:47,500
Well, I would think that the three master fishermen catch so much catch that it's enough for me too.

323
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:49,500
Come see me again.

324
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:52,500
Same words, you come and see me.

325
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:55,500
Yeah, take good care of yourself.

326
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:58,500
So do you. Thank you for everything.

327
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:06,500
Aunt Hemuli didn't say anything.

328
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:09,500
In the name of truth, we were quite unfriendly to him.

329
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:12,500
Oh, this is where you all are in trouble.

330
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:13,500
Hey Hemuli.

331
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:18,500
My sister came to greet me. We haven't met for a long time.

332
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:22,500
Oh yes, he boasted that you are extremely reliable children.

333
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:23,500
Ai.

334
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:26,500
You're welcome, powerless law.

335
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:27,500
Hey.

336
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:33,500
My sister was worried about me.

337
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:35,500
I'm still alone.

338
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:42,500
Oh, aunt's umbrella.

339
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:43,500
Six.

340
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:45,500
Channels.

341
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:47,500
Let's save aunt.

342
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:50,500
Help. Help.

343
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:54,500
Aunt Hemuli, how long will it take. Help is near.

344
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:56,500
Aunty, please release me.

345
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:04,500
Just don't decide to let go.

346
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:06,500
Let's hit.

347
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:08,500
The rescue was successful.

348
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:09,500
Give it to me.

349
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:13,500
Are you OK?

350
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:17,500
Aunt Hemuli has nothing to worry about. Nope.

351
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:23,500
Thanks for asking, Granny. I'm fine, I'm fine.

352
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:26,500
Hey, I was aiming for the umbrella.

353
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:27,500
A pinch.

354
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:29,500
Nipsu has become a gentleman.

355
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:34,500
Many thanks to everyone.

356
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:36,500
There was luck on the way.

357
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:41,500
Thank you all. Thank you, thank you.

358
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:42,500
I sneeze.

359
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:54,500
Come on, let's start cleaning.

360
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:59,500
Go briskly from one corner to the other, Grandma and Grandpa are coming tomorrow.

361
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:02,500
I'll be in command here until then.

362
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:03,500
Myy.

363
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:09,500
Yeah, I know, but you shouldn't have asked for the quilt back.

364
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:12,500
That woman is still our bone.

365
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:17,500
And not a badass suit either. You're not into him anymore, that's for sure.

366
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:19,500
Sell, what are you muttering there?

367
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:22,500
I'm fine, I'm not muttering anything.

368
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:30,500
Hey kids, here we come.

369
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:36,500
The Moomin house has been kept in such great condition that we can leave the children alone at any time.

370
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:37,500
Indeed.

371
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:38,500
And not.

372
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:39,500
And not.

373
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:41,500
Preferably not for as long as now.

374
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:44,500
I'm glad you've missed it.

375
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:48,500
I am pleasantly surprised, I thought we were in for chaos.

376
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:50,500
So am I.

377
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:56,500
Yes, chaos awaits you next time, if we can just be ourselves.

378
00:20:56,500 --> 00:21:02,500
I had a really nice time. Thank you kids.

379
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:28,500
Thanks to you guys.
