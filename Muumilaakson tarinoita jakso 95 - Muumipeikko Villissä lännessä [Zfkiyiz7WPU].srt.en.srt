1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
The time machine isn't broken. I'm just checking that it's OK to use.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Jaa.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Miss Isku, if you could go anywhere you wanted in a time machine, which era would you choose?

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
I think I would like to live in Rococo times.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Oh, for what?

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:24,000
I would live in a beautiful castle in the middle of flowers, and in the hall I would hold proms and handsome princely weddings.

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,000
And would say to you, beautiful lady, you must start a loan course.

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
It's getting late.

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Hihihihi.

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Hey, Moomipeikko.

11
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
what you now

12
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
A special outfit.

13
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
I want the good old wild west.

14
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Jaa.

15
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Where the Indians and cowboys fought each other.

16
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Where the Indians and cowboys fought each other.

17
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
And the setting sun lit the valleys aniline red.

18
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Oh, you're already leaving. What would you do there?

19
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
I would like to find myself a man.

20
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
what you now

21
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
So is that man missing?

22
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Whoops.

23
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I want to see if there is anything for me.

24
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
It's about you, but you're still half-faced.

25
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
You don't understand at all.

26
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Uh?

27
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Moomin wants to be a victorious lone rider.

28
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Men and women heading west in rocking carriages.

29
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Alone against the Indian and the dangers.

30
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
It was life. We're going to the wild west.

31
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Yep! Nuuska Muikkunen, Would you like to come too?

32
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Yeah, not really.

33
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Nuuska Muikkunen does not want to travel with all of us.

34
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
It's not like that.

35
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Now we need more oil.

36
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Mamma, where is the slot machine oil at?

37
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Moomipappa is very excited.

38
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
It's good I want help.

39
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
No what!

40
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
The time machine is gone.

41
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Good lord, the kids have gone on a trip alone.

42
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
And they left me here.

43
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Although I just wanted to go to the wild west.

44
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Wild West

45
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
This is the Wild West.

46
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Worth seeing.

47
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
That's right! Nothing.

48
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,000
You can already feel the inviting smell of campfires.

49
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:55,280
Like that? It smells like shit.

50
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:58,360
You can see smoke over there. And people.

51
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:01,440
You know, Indians.

52
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:06,280
Are Indians dangerous?

53
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:08,360
No, mine is more dangerous.

54
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:11,440
What do you mean? Nothing.

55
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:14,520
Look at the cattle farm and how many cows.

56
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:17,520
I'm a cattle rancher.

57
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:21,600
Single calf.

58
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:25,680
Hello, my horse. Go for it. A hobo, a hobo.

59
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:31,760
A stupid pet too. Why don't you move?

60
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:39,840
Whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop.

61
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:44,840
Whoops. The head is gone. And the farm has a tail.

62
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:47,920
This was the end.

63
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Too big for you.

64
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:56,080
No cow is too big for a real herdsman.

65
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:59,160
Yes, the cow is always caught.

66
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:01,240
Hey, let's wait.

67
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:03,320
Get off the end of the breakaway rope.

68
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:06,400
Oh, Peikka. And I can't, when finally...

69
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:08,480
Oh, Peikka.

70
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:11,520
I finally caught the cow...

71
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:13,600
I'll come to the rescue.

72
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:15,680
Uh, uh, uh...

73
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:18,760
No, no, no, no, you're asking for help!

74
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:20,840
Don't go here and there!

75
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:22,920
Uh, uh...

76
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Au!

77
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:28,080
What was it? So what?

78
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:34,920
Even the whiny cattle thieves. Stop bullying my herd of cows.

79
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,000
You will soon be swinging on a tree branch.

80
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:40,160
Oh, let's rock.

81
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:42,240
Oh, Peikka, stop.

82
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:45,320
The trading game can be left for another time.

83
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:52,680
Hey, the herd is on the loose!

84
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:54,760
Paatan!

85
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:58,360
Oh, terrible.

86
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:01,440
I hate cows. So do I!

87
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,800
Let's push in!

88
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:10,280
Yay!

89
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:16,360
Help!

90
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:20,480
The men must have gone.

91
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:22,560
The herd became agitated.

92
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:30,680
It wasn't my fault?

93
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:34,480
We better get out of here right now.

94
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:35,480
Tel!

95
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:38,480
Sorry.

96
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:42,480
City.

97
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:44,480
I'm hungry and thirsty.

98
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:47,480
Let's bark something small.

99
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:48,480
Let's go already.

100
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:54,480
Hey, doesn't this look like a saloon?

101
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:57,480
At least it smells nice.

102
00:05:58,480 --> 00:05:59,480
Bye, bye.

103
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:01,480
Hey, wait for me.

104
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:02,480
Oh!

105
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:04,480
Au!

106
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:08,480
Moi!

107
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:12,480
Waiter, that old familiar cowboy special pancake.

108
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:14,480
And milk to drink!

109
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:16,480
Same dose for me.

110
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:18,480
And to me.

111
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:20,480
Milk and pancake.

112
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:27,480
Good, we have more cows than people here, so there must be plenty of milk.

113
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:31,480
Have we ever met?

114
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:35,480
It's our first time here.

115
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:37,480
We just came.

116
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:38,480
Really?

117
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:39,480
Yes.

118
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:41,480
We want those portions.

119
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:43,480
They are coming.

120
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:51,480
It is...

121
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:55,480
Why is the service slowing down?

122
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:57,480
Do you have any problems?

123
00:06:57,480 --> 00:07:00,480
No, it isn't.

124
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:03,480
Now I know why he looks so familiar.

125
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:08,480
He is the wanted cattle thief, looking very young.

126
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:13,480
Hey, what's up there? No service here at all?

127
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:15,480
Whoah, whoah, here we go.

128
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:19,480
They are going to surprise you. They demanded the cash register at gunpoint.

129
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:22,480
Hands up or something.

130
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:24,480
Don't count playing.

131
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:27,480
It was spent.

132
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:30,480
Peculiar. What are you really freaking out about?

133
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:31,480
Don't ask me.

134
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:35,480
Sheriff, come help the wanted man here.

135
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:38,480
What does that mean?

136
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:41,480
That the police are looking for him.

137
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:43,480
Let's go.

138
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:48,480
Moomin cake.

139
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:51,480
A bad picture of a Moomin doll.

140
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:53,480
Too bad.

141
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:56,480
The cow fight was not without consequences.

142
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:59,480
Oh terrible, what are we going to do?

143
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:03,480
Shall we be hanged immediately if we are caught?

144
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:05,480
I must not be hanged.

145
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:07,480
Something has to be done.

146
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:09,480
Moomin cake.

147
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:11,480
How do we get through this?

148
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:15,480
Without flinching!

149
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:17,480
No, no shooting.

150
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:20,480
At least I'm innocent.

151
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:24,480
Wretched cattle thieves, let's arrest you.

152
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:27,480
Don't shoot me with that gun.

153
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:29,480
I am not responsible for the consequences.

154
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:31,480
We are innocent.

155
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:33,480
That's what those cattle thieves always say.

156
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:35,480
They are terribly young.

157
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:37,480
Believe us, it was a joke.

158
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:40,480
We're just pretending to be herders.

159
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:43,480
It was a herdsman's game.

160
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:45,480
Sheriff, don't listen to them.

161
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:47,480
The thief still has the gun.

162
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:49,480
Oh gun, what do they mean?

163
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:50,480
Show it.

164
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:51,480
Clear.

165
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:52,480
This is a game.

166
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:53,480
Don't wait until I eat.

167
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:55,480
And, and, and, and, and, and.

168
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:57,480
A real muggle.

169
00:08:58,480 --> 00:08:59,480
The bank has been robbed.

170
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:01,480
Se oli Billy the Kid.

171
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:04,480
Right, or Billy the Kid?

172
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:09,480
Handle, handle, handle, handle.

173
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:15,480
Right.

174
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:17,480
Ai kuka?

175
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:20,480
One day you will get caught.

176
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:21,480
You'll see.

177
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:22,480
Now or never.

178
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:23,480
Let's get out of here.

179
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:25,480
I will never come here.

180
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:27,480
Oh, what a fascinating man.

181
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:29,480
Miskuneti, what are you dreaming about?

182
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:31,480
We must escape.

183
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:34,480
Please wait.

184
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:36,480
I'm raging my sin...

185
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:38,480
Are we far enough?

186
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:41,480
I can't run.

187
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:43,480
We're probably safe by now.

188
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:47,480
Why am I always pale?

189
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:49,480
It's all Moomin's fault.

190
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:52,480
Why did he have to try to ride a cow?

191
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:55,480
Billy the Kid had him under his spell.

192
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:58,480
Try to understand myy.

193
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:01,480
Understanding is put to the test.

194
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:03,480
Forgive me.

195
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:04,480
Let's go already.

196
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:07,480
Let's try to get back to Moomilaakso as soon as possible.

197
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:11,480
Hey wait where did we leave the time machine.

198
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:16,480
Someone will come over there.

199
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:19,480
The sheriff is after us.

200
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:21,480
I don't want to go to the gallows.

201
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:23,480
That someone is not from the city.

202
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:26,480
A pawnbroker.

203
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:28,480
Tough robber.

204
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:32,480
Come on miss, you won't get too excited again.

205
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:34,480
Billy the Kid we saw.

206
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:37,480
What the hell does he want from us?

207
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:42,480
You all got out of town.

208
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:45,480
True, we have you to thank for that.

209
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:47,480
It won't last, colleague.

210
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:49,480
Why did you ride here?

211
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:52,480
I was interested to see how you got on.

212
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:53,480
How did you survive?

213
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:54,480
Or so.

214
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:55,480
What matter?

215
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:57,480
The sun is about to set.

216
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:59,480
You can't stay overnight in the desert.

217
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:01,480
Come to me.

218
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:03,480
Is this an invitation?

219
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:05,480
We don't agree to be swayed by gangsters.

220
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:07,480
Miss your hand.

221
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:08,480
Will you take me for a ride?

222
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:11,480
Miss Isku, we're going to Moomin Valley.

223
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:13,480
Well, get on your horses.

224
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:17,480
Deny yourself.

225
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:19,480
Maybe they won't come?

226
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:21,480
They will come if they want.

227
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:23,480
Hit miss, wait.

228
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:26,480
That hard face, where are you taking the blow girl.

229
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:28,480
Bring him back.

230
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:34,480
What is it about?

231
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:38,480
Bank robbery and rode his way with a hit girl.

232
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:40,480
It's terrible.

233
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:42,480
Back before it gets dark.

234
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:43,480
Joo.

235
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:46,480
Oh my, light-footed hepsankeikka.

236
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:49,480
Deny yourself.

237
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:58,480
Where did the bank robber take the hit girl?

238
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:00,480
Moomin, don't mourn.

239
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:02,480
We will find him.

240
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:04,480
What if we don't?

241
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:06,480
We will find him.

242
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:08,480
I know, but still...

243
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:09,480
What is that?

244
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:11,480
Pinch, what do you mean?

245
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:13,480
Wait, I'll be right back.

246
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:18,480
I can't believe my eyes.

247
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:21,480
I found the coin.

248
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:26,480
I thought you found the lead to find the blow girl.

249
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:28,480
If you guarantee coins, there will be more.

250
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:30,480
Is there? Where?

251
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:32,480
Behind your back.

252
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:33,480
Nope.

253
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:35,480
Oh, money.

254
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:37,480
About that many coins.

255
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:39,480
And they are all mine.

256
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:41,480
Wow, money, money.

257
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:43,480
Yeah, that's a lot of coins.

258
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:45,480
Pretty remarkable.

259
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:47,480
We sense something.

260
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:55,480
Maybe, Moomipeikko, notice.

261
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:57,480
Does it make you tired?

262
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:59,480
No, not at all.

263
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:01,480
I am under the spell of a wonderful sunset.

264
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:03,480
So.

265
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:05,480
The wilderness continues as far as the eye can see.

266
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:07,480
Sunsets don't even bother me sometimes.

267
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:09,480
It can't be worse.

268
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:13,480
Now we are there.

269
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:15,480
There's also a home there.

270
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:17,480
Oh, that must be charming.

271
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:19,480
We had a day.

272
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:21,480
I can buy anything with these coins.

273
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:23,480
Idiot, nothing to buy here.

274
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:25,480
Not so.

275
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:27,480
Go ahead, forget the money and go to sleep.

276
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:29,480
I'll be hungry too.

277
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:31,480
Oh.

278
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:33,480
I'll be hungry too.

279
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:35,480
I'll be hungry too.

280
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:37,480
I'll be hungry too.

281
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:39,480
I'll be hungry too.

282
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:41,480
I'll be hungry too.

283
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:43,480
I'll be hungry too.

284
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:45,480
I'll be hungry too.

285
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:47,480
I'll be hungry too.

286
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:49,480
What was it?

287
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:51,480
Coyote.

288
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:53,480
Like it's hungry. It scares me.

289
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:55,480
It won't eat you.

290
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:57,480
You are too ugly.

291
00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:59,480
I am.

292
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:01,480
Don't be afraid. I was guarding.

293
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:03,480
What is the niiskunnie doing right now?

294
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:05,480
I hope he's okay.

295
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:11,480
A romantic howl.

296
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:13,480
It was Coyote.

297
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:15,480
Do you make the same noise when you're angry?

298
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:17,480
Don't be stupid.

299
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:19,480
I'm not a wolf.

300
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:21,480
I'm just playing now.

301
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:23,480
What do you say about this?

302
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:25,480
That good like this.

303
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:27,480
I have a 4S.

304
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:29,480
What is it possible?

305
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:31,480
Why did you get angry?

306
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:33,480
I can't stand this!

307
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:35,480
Oh, I won.

308
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:37,480
You said you don't know how to play cards.

309
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:39,480
But you still know, don't you?

310
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:41,480
Oh, did you say something?

311
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:43,480
Let's play one more round.

312
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:45,480
And not play.

313
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:47,480
I have enough money, even if I rob a bank every day.

314
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:49,480
Oh, well, I'm starting to wait.

315
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:51,480
You can sleep in the bed.

316
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:53,480
I'm going to the sofa in the room.

317
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:55,480
Doesn't this one have a guest bed?

318
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:57,480
Well, it really isn't.

319
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:59,480
Don't you have friends in the village?

320
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:01,480
Friends?

321
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:03,480
Who needs them?

322
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:05,480
Good night.

323
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:07,480
Good night.

324
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:09,480
Here's another coin.

325
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:11,480
We're probably going in the right direction.

326
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:13,480
I don't care about coins now.

327
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:15,480
I want to sleep.

328
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:17,480
When you sleep for me,

329
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:19,480
coyotes will eat you.

330
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:21,480
No wait!

331
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:23,480
That's it.

332
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:25,480
Ha, Bill's hideout.

333
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:27,480
I want to sleep.

334
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:29,480
I want to sleep.

335
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:31,480
I want to sleep.

336
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:33,480
I want to sleep.

337
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:35,480
I want to sleep.

338
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:37,480
Ha, Bill's hideout.

339
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:39,480
Did you find the neck lady?

340
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:41,480
Sshh, more.

341
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:43,480
Did you see my neck?

342
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:51,480
There's nobody there.

343
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:53,480
Let me have a look.

344
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:55,480
Sells to me. There is nothing to look at.

345
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:57,480
I want to see it with my own eyes.

346
00:15:57,480 --> 00:15:59,480
Shhh!

347
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:01,480
Billy.

348
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:03,480
What is he talking about?

349
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:05,480
So.

350
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:15,480
What's the commotion?

351
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:17,480
Wow, my head is ringing!

352
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:19,480
Let's go get the nick girl.

353
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:21,480
Let's go get the nick girl.

354
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:25,480
It was cunning to follow us.

355
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:27,480
Come closer.

356
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:29,480
Hm.

357
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:33,480
We came to pick up Niskunneid.

358
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:35,480
Let him go.

359
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:39,480
The law is a braggart boasting over my dead body.

360
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:41,480
Only strength ends here,

361
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:43,480
only the strong survive here.

362
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:45,480
Feel free to shoot me anytime

363
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:51,480
but a true hero fights eye to eye and takes what he wants.

364
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:53,480
I move to the side before it crashes.

365
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:55,480
A pinch!

366
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:57,480
A pinch!

367
00:16:57,480 --> 00:16:59,480
The law of Svillinänne is followed here.

368
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:01,480
Yes, but when that...

369
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:03,480
What are you waiting for?

370
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:07,480
When you take it and smash it, I shot Vill in the skull.

371
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:10,480
Don't be stupid. All I have is a water gun.

372
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:12,480
Billy dies laughing.

373
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:15,480
You would have had a great opportunity to show what you can do.

374
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:17,480
I'll show.

375
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:19,480
What are you talking about? I'm ready.

376
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:21,480
Poomenta, Billy.

377
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:23,480
You came right after me.

378
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:25,480
Look what's here.

379
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:27,480
I won in a card game.

380
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:29,480
Don't slack off.

381
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:32,480
Billy has challenged Moomin to a duel.

382
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:35,480
And Moomin will fight for your honor.

383
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:38,480
Will Moomin and Billy fight over me?

384
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:40,480
Lovely.

385
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:44,480
I tell you what. Play me cards.

386
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:46,480
Not good for quality.

387
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:49,480
I have no game luck because of you.

388
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:51,480
Let's think about it.

389
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:54,480
Shall we see who wins the rodeo?

390
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:58,480
Yes, the one who stays awake the longest wins.

391
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:00,480
What do you say to that?

392
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:04,480
All right. I agree.

393
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:16,480
Don't fall.

394
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:18,480
Moomin is a prude.

395
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:21,480
It's fine, but don't let him run too hard.

396
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:24,480
Viskuneiti, don't joke about giving advice.

397
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:30,480
Billy is clever.

398
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:32,480
Moomi, stay back.

399
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:35,480
Oh, calm down.

400
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:38,480
Moomin will fall off the ride at any moment.

401
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:40,480
What can we do?

402
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:41,480
Well, something, of course.

403
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:42,480
Hey sell, be careful.

404
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:46,480
A lazy cow too.

405
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:48,480
Billy, shut up a little.

406
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:50,480
Sell, be careful.

407
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:53,480
Bulls get angry when they see red.

408
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:55,480
Give up, Ipana.

409
00:18:57,480 --> 00:18:59,480
Hey, you don't know who I am.

410
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:07,480
That, what?

411
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:10,480
Hey listen, tyler, don't tease the bull.

412
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:15,480
No, no, no, no.

413
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:17,480
No, no, no, no, no.

414
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:19,480
Can't come here.

415
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:21,480
Myy.

416
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:23,480
You can't, stop Sonni.

417
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:28,480
Myy.

418
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:31,480
No, no, this is how it has to be now.

419
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:33,480
You can't, you can't come.

420
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:35,480
Myy.

421
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:38,480
Stop Sonni.

422
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:48,480
Ohion.

423
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:50,480
Moomin, hey.

424
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:52,480
Moomin, hey.

425
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:54,480
Good, good.

426
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:58,480
I'm fine, but how did Billy get better?

427
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:01,480
Billy, did you get hurt?

428
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:03,480
Wake up already.

429
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:05,480
Miss Nisko, don't worry.

430
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:08,480
What are you going to do now?

431
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:13,480
Oh hello.

432
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:16,480
I admit that I lost.

433
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:20,480
Miss Nisko, you can be proud of those friends.

434
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:24,480
Yes, thank you Moomin for fighting for me.

435
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:27,480
Don't, everyone's watching.

436
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:30,480
Five of it, I love you.

437
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:37,480
It's so quiet when the kids are gone.

438
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:39,480
I miss them.

439
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:41,480
I miss them too.

440
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:43,480
Oh heaven.

441
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:45,480
Welcome home.

442
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:48,480
Glad you got back safely.

443
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:49,480
Here we are.

444
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:51,480
We had a little adventure.

445
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:53,480
Moomin was a hero.

446
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:55,480
A man's gotta do what a man's gotta do.

447
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:57,480
It's like you've changed somehow.

448
00:20:57,480 --> 00:21:00,480
Our son has grown up.

449
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:01,480
Oh, it is.

450
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:04,480
The Moomins have become wildly manly.

451
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:07,480
But I can thank the little seller for that.

452
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:10,480
And sale has finally become feminine.

453
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:13,480
Well, yeah, maybe, I guess.

454
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:42,480
Thank you.
