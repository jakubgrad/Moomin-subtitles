1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Hemuli had told Moomin about the goldfish. The fish immediately took over Moomin's thoughts.

2
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
My grandfather's mother listen, I saw a goldfish.

3
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
You haven't seen it.

4
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Well, I'm a botanist. Goldfish only appear under certain conditions and rarely.

5
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
I don't understand.

6
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Well, you can only see goldfish at the end of summer.

7
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
At this hour?

8
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Mmm.

9
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
It should be a sunny afternoon after the rain.

10
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
It narrows the possibilities.

11
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
And you have to be calm.

12
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
The lake is shallow, even on rough terrain.

13
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Not you.

14
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:09,000
There are some other conditions that grandpa didn't know about. So that luck is needed that the goldfish would see.

15
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Ice, it's a cloudy sky for the lake. It is located behind the lonely mountains.

16
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
If you have to cross mountains, the round trip will take more than two days.

17
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Not necessarily, if you take a short cut, you can get back in a day.

18
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Really?

19
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Joo.

20
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Have you been to the lake?

21
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Just once.

22
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Will you take me there?

23
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Are you serious?

24
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:44,000
I am. I want to see a goldfish and catch it if I can at all.

25
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Catching up is not easy.

26
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Why not?

27
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000
The goldfish is at the door. Few have even seen it.

28
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
That's why I want to see a goldfish.

29
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Just you?

30
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I didn't eat in them either, women have those whims.

31
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Who else?

32
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Well, small shop.

33
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
What about Snipsu?

34
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Yes, he also wants to join.

35
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Four.

36
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Better to take a longer route.

37
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Why can't we take a shortcut?

38
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Well, when the path is overgrown and it takes you through the forest.

39
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
There are no witches!

40
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
No longer.

41
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Then there's no problem.

42
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Witches or not, but the forest is dark even during the day.

43
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
At least we are not afraid.

44
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Towels!

45
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Good morning.

46
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Sorry, I overslept.

47
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
The girls haven't come yet either.

48
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Snipsu, you're early.

49
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:31,000
I dreamed that I caught a goldfish, and I didn't sleep properly after that.

50
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Let's go.

51
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Aren't we waiting for the niskunit and selling?

52
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
We agreed that latecomers will not be expected.

53
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Besides, today's trip is too heavy for the girls, so it's better this way.

54
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Which is better this way?

55
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Sell. You came.

56
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
But what I said is true.

57
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
The trip is tough.

58
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Not for me!

59
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Moomintroll.

60
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Snipsu, speed up!

61
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
I'm still sleepy.

62
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Speed up!

63
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Speed up!

64
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Speed up!

65
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
I'm still sleepy.

66
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Why did we have to leave so early?

67
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
We won't make it back the same day.

68
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
We're taking a shortcut.

69
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Still, it's already night when we get home.

70
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:30,000
The journey home is not as hectic, because then I have water and a goldfish in my bucket.

71
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Snipsu, I don't think you'll catch a goldfish.

72
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Then the whole thing is pointless.

73
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:40,000
I thought you understood that we can be happy forever if we even catch a glimpse of a goldfish.

74
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Yes, but we're on time and we don't make a fuss.

75
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Well, it's true.

76
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
I'll catch the goldfish.

77
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Where are they going in the morning, Ani Varhain?

78
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
How long is the journey to the forest?

79
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
The sky of a couple of hours.

80
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,000
So tell me, how long does it take to go from one end of the forest to the other?

81
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Likewise for a couple of hours.

82
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Ooo, so long!

83
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Surely there are no witches there?

84
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
There isn't.

85
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Armi, I'm not afraid of witches.

86
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Gee, I guess not.

87
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
I won't drop a drop.

88
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Before there were witches.

89
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Oh, don't.

90
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
How else would the name of the forest be that forest?

91
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Say that shit.

92
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Are you sure there are no witches in the forest now?

93
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
They're hardly back.

94
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
It doesn't scare me any more.

95
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Good morning, where is Moomin?

96
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
He went out while you were still sleeping.

97
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Oh yeah, goldfish.

98
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
It's going to be hot here.

99
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
I would have liked to go with the children.

100
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Don't dawdle, you've got work to do.

101
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:14,000
I try to concentrate on writing, but the goldfish invades my subconscious.

102
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
I could write a whole chapter about it in my memoirs.

103
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Jaa.

104
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Oh, I wish I were free to go.

105
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
You are like a little child.

106
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:28,000
It occurred to me that children might get lost in the woods.

107
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Don't worry, Snuff is on its way.

108
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Haunted forest.

109
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
The witches have been able to come back.

110
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Yeah, stop it.

111
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Now listen up muggle heads.

112
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Stay on my kinders so you don't get lost.

113
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
HEY!

114
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
GRANDFATHER!

115
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
It's pretty dark here.

116
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Sunlight cannot filter through the branches.

117
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
The sky has clouded over.

118
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
And the wind picks up.

119
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
The wind is bad.

120
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Shouldn't it be raining now?

121
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Well, if it doesn't rain for long.

122
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Must not.

123
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Me kastumme.

124
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
So it seems.

125
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Uh, let's run.

126
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Ota.

127
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Oh, thank you.

128
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
With help, the weather did not predict rain.

129
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
This rain won't last long.

130
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
How do you know?

131
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
From experience.

132
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Five of the rain.

133
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
So do I.

134
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Let's hurry to the lake before the afternoon.

135
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Let's continue the journey.

136
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
In the SankasÃ¤ forest, we don't step badly.

137
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Are you that excited?

138
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Stickman, what are you doing?

139
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Ota.

140
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Oh, thank you.

141
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Excited.

142
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Stickman, what are we going to do?

143
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Well, let's see now.

144
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Patti!

145
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
We get wet like rats.

146
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Let's press somewhere sheltered from the rain again.

147
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,000
And where could such protection be found?

148
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Kunalatakai.

149
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Yes?

150
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
What's wrong now?

151
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
A cottage looms over there.

152
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
The cabin is just a mess.

153
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
It does keep the rain out though.

154
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Whoa! Hi! Is there anyone there?

155
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Deserted.

156
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,000
The cottage has been empty for a long time.

157
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
It has been empty for a long time.

158
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
It has been empty for a long time.

159
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
It has been empty for a long time.

160
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
It has been empty for a long time.

161
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,000
The cottage has been empty for a long time.

162
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Who has lived here before others?

163
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,000
I do know. And yes you know too.

164
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Do you mean that...

165
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
A witch has lived here.

166
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Look around you.

167
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Those tricks, by any measure.

168
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Rautpata.

169
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Poison.

170
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
What about a broom?

171
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
The witch has flown her way with it.

172
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
There's someone here.

173
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Cry?

174
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Let's go away.

175
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
The sound is heard.

176
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Sounds like that.

177
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Don't you dare, little one.

178
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Let's go away.

179
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Miss Nisku, don't whore me.

180
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
ha Isu Li.

181
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Well, you finally got scared.

182
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
At least I wasn't scared.

183
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Nipsu behaved badly when he passed out.

184
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Hearing my voice.

185
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Tell me where you're going.

186
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Don't play and get angry.

187
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Starts fair.

188
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
There.

189
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Clear.

190
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
hey what's up

191
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
This is the lake.

192
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
It is.

193
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Where is the goldfish?

194
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,000
I can't say because I haven't seen it before.

195
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
All requirements have been met.

196
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
The goldfish will appear soon.

197
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
No goldfish!

198
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Help me.

199
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
I'll catch a fish even if I die.

200
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
A goldfish swims deep.

201
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
I don't see any fish.

202
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Maybe Hemuli was fooling us.

203
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
That's not Hemul's case.

204
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
What?

205
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Me.

206
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Goldfish.

207
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Goldfish.

208
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Goldfish.

209
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Goldfish.

210
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Goldfish.

211
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Goldfish.

212
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Goldfish.

213
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Goldfish.

214
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Goldfish.

215
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Goldfish.

216
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Goldfish.

217
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Not like Hemul.

218
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Sit down and wait.

219
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
A goldfish will definitely jump out.

220
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Hyper.

221
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Did you go through all the trouble of the trip just to watch the fish?

222
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
There was talk of asking.

223
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
And it seems that there will be more to talk about.

224
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Hey, don't make waves.

225
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Oh.

226
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Did they go on such an arduous journey?

227
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,000
I academic their youth.

228
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:42,000
I would have gone along and put the work on hold.

229
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Are you implying that you are still young?

230
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Well, I don't feel old.

231
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:50,000
It would be exciting to see Kultakala with your own eyes.

232
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Nipsu bragged that he would catch a fish.

233
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
How?

234
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Online probably.

235
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,000
And he brings the fish home in a bucket.

236
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Out.

237
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
How so?

238
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Jaa.

239
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:13,000
I think I forgot to tell the kids one very important point.

240
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Hey, muli said that Goldfish do not show up at the lake all the time.

241
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,000
And who has eaten the Goldfish?

242
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Stinky mouth shut.

243
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Where did you see the Goldfish?

244
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:47,000
I saw a fish jumping, but I couldn't tell if it was a goldfish.

245
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
It was too far.

246
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Only the outline of the fish is visible in this light.

247
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Nothing can be said about its color.

248
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Look, there's a ferry over there!

249
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Hey, let's take a ferry to the middle of the lake.

250
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,000
The ferry is not for all of us.

251
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Don't worry, it won't sink.

252
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
I'll stay.

253
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Ipsu, how will you catch a fish if you're afraid of water?

254
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Hey, Stinkbug, Can you help me?

255
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:25,000
The goldfish is gold in these, it can be sold for a good price.

256
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Niisku, miss, did you see a fish on these roads?

257
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:42,000
I think so, but I can't be sure.

258
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Did you see the Goldfish?

259
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
That's what I saw.

260
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,000
I don't see anything.

261
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Let's wait here.

262
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Yes, you can't think of anything better than that.

263
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
I won't leave until I've seen the Goldfish.

264
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,000
No fish in the sky!

265
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:06,000
The fish thrive in the reeds.

266
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Oops, the ferry is far away.

267
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Others want to see the Goldfish, but I'm going to catch it.

268
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Well, how do you know that, even if you still catch a fish in the bucket.

269
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Did you see the fish?

270
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,000
I also saw melting gold.

271
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:31,000
What did I say, now I'll shut up.

272
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Goldfish.

273
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
It's been forever.

274
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Let's go back to the beach to make it to Moomin Valley in time.

275
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Perhaps we had too high expectations.

276
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
I'm terribly disappointed.

277
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:05,000
I'm sure I'll see a flickering Goldfish.

278
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Another time.

279
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Let's stop.

280
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Did you see the Goldfish?

281
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Goldfish.

282
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
It's big.

283
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
It's big.

284
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
It's big.

285
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
Goldfish yes.

286
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
Great!

287
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
I saw the Goldfish.

288
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
I caught the Goldfish.

289
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
We caught a fish.

290
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
Moomin troll.

291
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
I caught the fish.

292
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,000
Ai.

293
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Yeah, I caught a Goldfish.

294
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
Have you got sunstroke?

295
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:20,000
I have a Goldfish here.

296
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:25,000
Nipsu, do you think it's a Goldfish?

297
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
Yes?

298
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
That's a different fish.

299
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:32,000
As a golden boy, I asked for it.

300
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:35,000
Maybe the sun made it sparkle gold?

301
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
You said it's a Goldfish.

302
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:40,000
Nipsu, release the fish back into the lake.

303
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
It's not Goldfish.

304
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
Oh.

305
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:52,000
Look how happily the fish swims.

306
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
Goldfish.

307
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,000
Look how happily the fish swims.

308
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:00,000
It looked like a goldfish at first.

309
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,000
We believe you, Nipsu.

310
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
Let's go home.

311
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:21,000
It was hard for Nipsu and Smelly to admit that they had caught an ordinary fish.

312
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:28,000
But the Moomin hit the daring Moomin and the mouse had become part of a rare piece of luck.
