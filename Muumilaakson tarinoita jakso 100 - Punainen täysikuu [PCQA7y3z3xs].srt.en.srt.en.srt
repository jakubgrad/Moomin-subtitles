1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
The moon has turned red.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Look how the moon cancels out in red.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Amazing.

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Maybe the moon is a shame elevator for some reason, or what do you think?

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Oh, Nipsu, you really are a bit intelligent.

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,000
How so?

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,000
I am.

8
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,000
I am.

9
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,000
I am.

10
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,000
I am.

11
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,000
I am.

12
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,000
I am.

13
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,000
I am.

14
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
I am.

15
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,000
I am.

16
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,000
I am.

17
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,000
I am.

18
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,000
I am.

19
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,000
I am.

20
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,000
I am.

21
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,000
I am.

22
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
I am.

23
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I am.

24
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,000
I am.

25
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I am.

26
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I am.

27
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I am.

28
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
I am.

29
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I am.

30
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
I am.

31
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I am.

32
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
I am.

33
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I am.

34
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
I am.

35
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I am.

36
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
I am.

37
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I am.

38
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
I am.

39
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I am.

40
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
I am.

41
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I am.

42
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
I am.

43
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I am.

44
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
I am.

45
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I am.

46
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I am.

47
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I am.

48
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
I am.

49
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Count, count, count, count, count, count, count, count, count, count

50
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Good evening everyone. Isn't it a wonderful moonlight or what?

51
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Huh, is it amazing?

52
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Don't you think the tree is somehow a bad omen?

53
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Not at all.

54
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Or rather, the most beautiful moon I've ever seen.

55
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I've always wanted to see a real red moon, and tomorrow is a full moon to top it off.

56
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
The blood-red hearing room, that's just a sight.

57
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Is it red at six in the evening?

58
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
That would be so much fun.

59
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
May the red moon bring you no misfortune.

60
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
For example, a volcanic eruption.

61
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Nipsu, you mustn't scare me.

62
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
The red moon is ahead.

63
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Judgment day is coming.

64
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Have you ever seen such an eerie moon before?

65
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Believe it or not, it's a bad omen.

66
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Dad, are you sick?

67
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
I hear you're getting a vertigo attack?

68
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:24,000
I wonder what that red flaming moon is trying to tell us.

69
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
What makes you sing so much?

70
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Ohikas, good evening, Moomins.

71
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Hemuli, you purr with satisfaction like a cat.

72
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Why wouldn't I be satisfied?

73
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Didn't you see what the moon was like yesterday?

74
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
That's me, don't kid me.

75
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
But how about that ominous color?

76
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Ominous?

77
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:54,000
That's right, you shouldn't have a reason to grin.

78
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,000
I would say that the moon was quite an attractive color.

79
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Or inflammatory?

80
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Hemuli has always been strange.

81
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Aren't you worried at all?

82
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
No, and I'll tell you why.

83
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:11,000
For me, next night will be the best ever.

84
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Namely, I get to know what my grandfather has bequeathed to me.

85
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Just don't say you won't see the whole will.

86
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Grandfather bequeathed me a seed,

87
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,000
which can only be sown during the red full moon.

88
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
What is that miracle seed?

89
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
No, it's a lucky tree seed.

90
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Or a lucky tree seed?

91
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Does that tree bring you luck then?

92
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Oh, how wonderful.

93
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Of course, even if I get large amounts of gold.

94
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Also, the chicken's brain, the lucky tree is not yours, but Hemul's heirloom tree.

95
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,000
I have no idea what fraction luck manifests in.

96
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
But it will be seen when I have planted the seed.

97
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,000
It's so exciting, oh, that...

98
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Father, do you believe Hemul?

99
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
I'm not sure.

100
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Here it is, the seed that brings happiness.

101
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Good seed.

102
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:35,000
I plant the seed of happiness here, and I talk to it every day.

103
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
The pit is ready.

104
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,000
The seed is gone, I put it on this stump.

105
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000
The lucky tree seed is gone.

106
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,000
I need to calm down, the seed was here.

107
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
What the hell.

108
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Vanna Hemuli doesn't need any more lucky seeds.

109
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
It would be fun to know what it tastes like.

110
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Or should it be roasted on fire first?

111
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Oh my God, oh my God.

112
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
I'm like that.

113
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
I'm like that.

114
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
I'm like that.

115
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
I'm like that.

116
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
I'm like that.

117
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
I'm like that.

118
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Mamma.

119
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
What my darling?

120
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
I feel strange.

121
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Like I got stung by the moon.

122
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Hi, have you seen any bandits here?

123
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Bandits? I don't remember seeing it.

124
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Hemuli, what happened?

125
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:49,000
The lucky seed has disappeared, someone has stolen it.

126
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Can you imagine?

127
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:56,000
If you see a suspicious looking guy, let me know!

128
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Ari was busy!

129
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Hemuli wasted the seed that makes rich.

130
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Too much tension is clearly not good for Hemul.

131
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Like everyone got a shot of the moon.

132
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,000
I want my happiness back!

133
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Hemuli has been behaving strangely since last night.

134
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Well, maybe.

135
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:22,000
The seed of the lucky tree has disappeared, come and find it!

136
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
A lucky seed?

137
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Maybe the seed is somehow related to the red moon.

138
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Hemuli runs to the police station.

139
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Hemuli, could you describe the wheel of the seed and its size?

140
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:47,000
When you knock on it, there is a hollow sound, is there any special characteristic?

141
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Or even a special identifier?

142
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:53,000
It's pointless because the seed is the only quality.

143
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Oh, I'm sorry.

144
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,000
What makes a particular seed so important?

145
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Policeman, it's not just any seed,

146
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:07,000
but at the same time special and unique.

147
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
You are the Moominvalley policeman,

148
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:14,000
and your job is to track down your stolen Christmas.

149
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Well, that's fine, that's fine. Don't speed up.

150
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,000
But tell me, what is so remarkable about the seed?

151
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:25,000
When you are so serious, there must be some special aspect related to the seed.

152
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Yeah, yeah. That's right, yeah. Absolutely.

153
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Terrible things happen, find it yesterday.

154
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,000
What? What kind of horrors?

155
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,000
So, when the thing is that...

156
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Night...

157
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:48,000
All right. I'm only telling you this secret.

158
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,000
This is then strictly confidential.

159
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
I'm just an ear.

160
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Before find the seed before evening.

161
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Kuupu brings Moominvalley from the sky to the neck, and everything goes to pieces.

162
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
What? Terrible!

163
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,000
I don't believe it.

164
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:11,000
The magic power of the seed prevents the moon from falling.

165
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:15,000
I'm a man of science and I know. It's okay for you to believe me.

166
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:22,000
For which we find the seed before night falls, Moomin Valley is no more.

167
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Oh good miracle.

168
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
What do we do?

169
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Let's cheer everyone!

170
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Good. And do your best.

171
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,000
And not a word about the falling moon.

172
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
It's okay!

173
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Sorry for the slight exaggeration.

174
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
I had to come up with something scary.

175
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,000
The police chief would not have believed me otherwise.

176
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Shut up!

177
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,000
I heard when Hemuli told the police chief.

178
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,000
We must escape or be crushed.

179
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
I saw a big swarm of wattles.

180
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Did you really hear about falling?

181
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Let's ask Hemul.

182
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Let's find out right away.

183
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:09,000
I'm sure the police chief will find a seed in no time.

184
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Hemuli!

185
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Did you find the seed?

186
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Now here we are at the opposite side!

187
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
How so?

188
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:23,000
The rumor that the hood from the sky has spread to Moomin Valley like wildfire!

189
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
The whole Moomin valley is!

190
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
How is that possible?

191
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Lord time!

192
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Now the villagers are coming here!

193
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
The sky is starry!

194
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,000
No, no, no! Try to calm down!

195
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Hemuli, is it true that the hood is coming to Moominvalley tonight?

196
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Tell us the truth!

197
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
The truth, Hemuli!

198
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
That...

199
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Hemuli, let us speak the truth, we are waiting!

200
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Truth or nothing!

201
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
That, yeah, yeah!

202
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,000
So it's true, we all crush!

203
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
We must hike!

204
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Good gentlemen!

205
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:14,000
We have to blow coal together and try to save Johan, the oldest multi-villager in the country!

206
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Joo!

207
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Oh, oh, what do I do now? I can no longer admit that I cheated.

208
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:25,000
I went too far in my carelessness.

209
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,000
This is getting out of hand!

210
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
I can't believe this is true!

211
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Such a terrible upheaval threatens!

212
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,000
My teeth can handle us!

213
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Oh!

214
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
I hear you're having more soup?

215
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
No, thank you.

216
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:08,000
It's hard for him to believe that another vilakso is about to fall.

217
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,000
I wouldn't want to believe that either.

218
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:14,000
However, if that is true, how about us then?

219
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:18,000
There will be devastation 100 times greater than after a hurricane!

220
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Mm, 1000 times bigger.

221
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:33,000
I can't think of a single place where I could wear a shirt.

222
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Oh, oh, well either again?

223
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Moomin is the owner of destruction and us with it, you and me.

224
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Don't worry!

225
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:50,000
I cave in the lonely mountains and crawl under the frying pan.

226
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Ah, what a wonderful dinner it was.

227
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
I have to go now.

228
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Where are you going?

229
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
It's a secret.

230
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Good wonder papa, what are you doing?

231
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Why are the books lying around?

232
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Hi mom, I'm here.

233
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
I don't see, where?

234
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Here.

235
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
What did you blow?

236
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,000
I was choosing books to take with me.

237
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:23,000
All books are important to me, like this one.

238
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
What book is that?

239
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:30,000
This book gave me Kimmoke to become a writer.

240
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Only you and Moomin-Pekko are more important in life there than books.

241
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Books are just as important to me.

242
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Really?

243
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,000
For example, grandma's home medicine book is priceless.

244
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
We are very similar.

245
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
So.

246
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Many books have already happened.

247
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:54,000
The entire Moomin House is full of beautiful memories gilded by time.

248
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Well, it is.

249
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Hey, waiting!

250
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Where are you going?

251
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Something like that.

252
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Hey, what's up there?

253
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Oh where?

254
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
I won't tell.

255
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Help!

256
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Where are you going?

257
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Just poop out.

258
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Oops, balloons.

259
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:28,000
What are you going to do with those balloons?

260
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:36,000
This is an air pack so you know if the moon falls from the sky and there is a lack of air,

261
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,000
so this air pack will save me.

262
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Hey, don't tell anyone that no one steals their business idea.

263
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
That was it.

264
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Very pinchy.

265
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Oh, Mother Whip.

266
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
What's wrong?

267
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
Saloo, what's wrong with you?

268
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
And all.

269
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:06,000
How are you so calm when it's all over next night?

270
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Maybe not calm now, rather tense.

271
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:12,000
I still don't really believe the whole thing.

272
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Don't try to console.

273
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
What were you ashamed of?

274
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Nothing.

275
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Swamp lady, what's up?

276
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
He said.

277
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
What are you crying for?

278
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Muvi mamma, why am I so sad, even though others are just excited?

279
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Hyys, marsh lady.

280
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,000
We go to the cave in the lonely mountains.

281
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
We are safe there.

282
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Don't bother crying.

283
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Niiskunöti Honey, give me your hand.

284
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Ladies and gentlemen.

285
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:44,000
This air pack makes you feel completely safe.

286
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Please come and shop when the weather is good.

287
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
That you skit!

288
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,000
You are trying to profit from a terrible natural disaster.

289
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
I'm of no use.

290
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Nobody buys.

291
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Hey, there's one more light burning in the bay.

292
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
That's right.

293
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
What's going on in the Moomin house?

294
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Hey, make way.

295
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:14,000
It's true, there is a light.

296
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Why is there a buzz in the Moomin house?

297
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:20,000
I guess they don't play music there.

298
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,000
They're always just crazier.

299
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Hey, what do I bring?

300
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,000
I'm about to go up.

301
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Isn't it beautiful?

302
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:48,000
I started getting into the party spirit.

303
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
See alta!

304
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
Wow, great cake.

305
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Oh, oh mom, what a filling cake.

306
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,000
I put all my baking skills into play.

307
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
The most amazing cake I've ever seen.

308
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Fortunately, the jerk isn't here.

309
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
You'll get more.

310
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Ha, I knew that.

311
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,000
You eat a full cake when I'm not there.

312
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:14,000
This has drawn you right into the cave.

313
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:17,000
A real cake, what is it baked for?

314
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Good evening, dear villagers.

315
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:28,000
We want to celebrate a little under the guise that we have had many fun moments in Moominvalley.

316
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Welcome to the group.

317
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Do you believe that Moominvalley will soon cease to exist?

318
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Honestly, I don't think so.

319
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
You skunk, good evening.

320
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
What's going on here?

321
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,000
We have a party. Come join the happy company.

322
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Oh, will you let me come too?

323
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Of course. You live in Moominvalley.

324
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
Oh, thank you.

325
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Stink, you know a lot of funny stuff. Don't you know?

326
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:10,000
Neither do I. I don't really know.

327
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
You do know.

328
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,000
You know. I'll tell you about those pranks.

329
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
What if you get angry?

330
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
Don't get angry.

331
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:23,000
For once, you can be sure that you won't get angry.

332
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Well, I'll tell you then.

333
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Ladies and gentlemen.

334
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Now you have a unique opportunity to hear about the skunk's kolttos.

335
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Let's start with Mrs. Viljonga.

336
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:44,000
I put that toad here in his bathtub.

337
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:50,000
And I washed those spiders in the powder box of Niiskunneid.

338
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
That's what I wanted to know.

339
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,000
I poured the glue into the mint jelly.

340
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
Oh, that was it.

341
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
I sprinkled pepper for sale.

342
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
That's what I suspected.

343
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:05,000
I graffitied the entire police station.

344
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:08,000
What? Did you do it?

345
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
Palliative care.

346
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:12,000
There were a few carousels in it.

347
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,000
Stinky, I really get excited about those pranks.

348
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Pepper is enough.

349
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Right. I could say more.

350
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,000
Tell me about the last villain meeting.

351
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
Oh, that's right.

352
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:32,000
This morning I went to visit the hemuli.

353
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,000
Onne Siemeni, this one.

354
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
Good, good miracle.

355
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:42,000
Stinky, how could you?

356
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:46,000
The shell of the seed sometimes clicked quite promisingly.

357
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:50,000
But it's so hard you can't break it.

358
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
Not at all.

359
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:57,000
Hemuli, this means that Moomin Valley has been saved.

360
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Cheers, cheers, cheers.

361
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Stink, I'll give you a Seed in memory.

362
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:08,000
But it was so important to you.

363
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:13,000
Dear Mr. Vekijo, I am very sorry to have caused you trouble.

364
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:17,000
And I made you believe that the hood will bring your neck.

365
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:20,000
It was actually a lie.

366
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:31,000
I lied so that the police chief would get serious about looking for Siemian.

367
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:34,000
And the Seed is not a seed of happiness either.

368
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:40,000
Honestly, I doubt there are any lucky trees.

369
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:45,000
I guess grandpa wanted me to plant a tree,

370
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:49,000
which would remind of him and the happy times together.

371
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:53,000
So, in this complete red pit.

372
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
Whoah!

373
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
Honey look.

374
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
Yep, uu isn't red anymore.

375
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
Just ordinary moonlight.

376
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
Oh, then again we saved.

377
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
Awesome, awesome!

378
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,000
Hey, it wasn't a problem in the first place!

379
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
Get out of the way, get out of the way!

380
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:22,000
Shut up, there's no reason to jump for joy.

381
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,000
Who are we to blame for this madness?

382
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
Hemulia, hemulia!

383
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:31,000
Well no, the culprit is Haisuli.

384
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
It sucks for someone.

385
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:37,000
ha Isu Li, ha Isu Li, ha Isu Li.

386
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:42,000
Well, Haisul must be punished.

387
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:46,000
The skunk lives for fun. What?

388
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
Goodbye.

389
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:00,000
A true seed of happiness when a tooth broke.

390
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
It was just a mess.

391
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
It was, but...

392
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
What, nitwit?

393
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:15,000
However, the main thing is that we have each other.

394
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:18,000
So yeah.
