00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:18,000
This year, Nuuska Muikkunen, who lives in his own conditions, has set up his tent on the bank of the river.

2
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:24,000
He intends to stay there until winter, in all harmony with the world.

3
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Moomin sometimes feels lonely and enjoys being surrounded by Nuuska Muikkunen.

4
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Snuff Muikkunen!

5
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Snuff Muikkunen!

6
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
He's not here, he's not!

7
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
He has forgotten and gone wandering.

8
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
How can he be comfortable alone?

9
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
I, too, miss solitude at that time.

10
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Shall we each go our separate ways?

11
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
We'd rather leave tomorrow.

12
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
We decided to leave today.

13
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
That's how we decided, you can't live from a joint decision.

14
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
You decided, not me.

15
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:03,000
You were involved in deciding, you also have to come and collect shells.

16
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I'm already going.

17
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Moi!

18
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
It's Ipsu!

19
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Where are you going?

20
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
I envied Nuuska Muikku.

21
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Why?

22
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Otherwise, just.

23
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
So he's gone?

24
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Maybe we'll find something as exciting as that hat.

25
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Yes, it was just a joke.

26
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Did you really throw it in the river?

27
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
We shouldn't have.

28
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
It seemed dangerous.

29
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
The hat turned me into a ghost animal.

30
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
But eggshells to clouds.

31
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Yeah, it was fun.

32
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Go see if I can find a pearl shell.

33
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Muvi, Pekko, wake up! Nisku's mother is in trouble.

34
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
What? What? What is it?

35
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Nisku's mother fell into the antlion's pit.

36
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
When we were playing hooky. Come on!

37
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Apply a little more!

38
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Give me a hand! Give me a hand!

39
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Antlion!

40
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Are you trying to mess with my pit?

41
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Well, I don't. I'll leave right away.

42
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Stop yelling now!

43
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
You're scaring my game!

44
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Niskun's mother, is everything alright?

45
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I'm not like him at all.

46
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
I don't necessarily feed the antlion.

47
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Oh, Pekko, help.

48
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Nipsu, fall into the pit.

49
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
What? Me?

50
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Don't be afraid. I am your safety.

51
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Nipsu, you're big enough for this job. Start going.

52
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
I'll blow you in the mouth.

53
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Snap, quick.

54
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
But I...

55
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Get down, you scumbag!

56
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
You yourself are a liar.

57
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Hoppita! Help!

58
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Nisku's mother grabbed Nipsu's leg.

59
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Help, it's eating my tail!

60
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
I'll take the sale of the soup!

61
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Thanks.

62
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Are you ready?

63
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Thanks.

64
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Let's go!

65
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
I know the secret.

66
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Tell me.

67
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,000
The magician's hat has drifted with the current onto the sand bar.

68
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Really?

69
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Terrible things happen every now and then.

70
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Oh.

71
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Maybe we should have thrown our hat elsewhere.

72
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Oh.

73
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,000
The hat is stuck in that tree trunk.

74
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:39,000
I can't really see, but can you.

75
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Speak up.

76
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Speak up.

77
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Speak up.

78
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Speak up.

79
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Speak up.

80
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Speak up.

81
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Speak up.

82
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Speak up.

83
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Speak up.

84
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Speak up.

85
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Speak up.

86
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Speak up.

87
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Speak up.

88
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Speak up.

89
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Speak up.

90
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Speak up.

91
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Speak up.

92
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Speak up.

93
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Speak up.

94
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Speak up.

95
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:03,000
But, oh my goodness, the water has turned red.

96
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:07,000
I guess the water has changed into something else in the hat.

97
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Hats off.

98
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Hopefully redness.

99
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Are you angry?

100
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Speak up.

101
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Speak up.

102
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Did you find the hat?

103
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
I found.

104
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Mp createisteka palk dominance

105
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Puh Works

106
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,000
What the hell are we doing to the hat?

107
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
You can never leave it anywhere.

108
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
You never know who's crawling in there.

109
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,000
But we can drink vaapukka juice every time we pour water into the hat.

110
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:04,000
It could be that the water turned into vaapukka juice because it was from this river.

111
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
We have to do it now.

112
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Swimmer, you look tired.

113
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,000
I woke up in the night, and I couldn't catch up with the dream anymore.

114
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
What exactly are you implying?

115
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,000
I know what you were doing. I supervised too.

116
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
You were with the snot.

117
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:46,000
You've been dreaming. I'm in a hurry. Thanks for the breakfast.

118
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,000
I know what you did. I tell you what.

119
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,000
It's terribly boring to listen to others explain their dreams.

120
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
What exactly is the matter?

121
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Not at all, grandma.

122
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Ah, he left again.

123
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Pah, little sell, no secret, funny things.

124
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Nus cam Ichinomiya year.

125
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
I know who the hat belongs to.

126
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
To whom?

127
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
For the magician.

128
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Magician?

129
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:32,000
I just saw Hemul, and he told me he saw the Magician.

130
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,000
I've had a dream about a flying witch.

131
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
On the back of a black panther.

132
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,000
A magician cares about nothing but the magician.

133
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,000
A magician cares about nothing but the magician.

134
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,000
The magician cares about nothing but rubies.

135
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:52,000
He chases them around the world riding his panther.

136
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
And when he lost his hat...

137
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:02,000
He must have been on Moomin's leg looking for rubies.

138
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Does the Magician have more than one hat?

139
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
I don't know.

140
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,000
The magician may not know where he has lost his hat.

141
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Maybe that's the way it is...

142
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,500
All the same. I want to try one thing with a hat.

143
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:19,000
What's up? Tell me.

144
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Antlions do not live up to their reputation at all.

145
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:33,000
It takes hours for them to dig themselves into the sand.

146
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,500
It only takes them an hour.

147
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:37,000
Only now you're narrating.

148
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,500
After all, one hour is a long time to dig in the sand.

149
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:44,000
Are you talking about me?

150
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:48,000
We're talking about how fast you can dig into the sand.

151
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Faster than you can imagine.

152
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Moomin said you dig in the sand when you feel it, but I don't believe it.

153
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Snuff claims that you need hours to dig in.

154
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,000
I can show.

155
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,500
Pretty fast. Can't say anything else.

156
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:13,500
Yes, it was a secret, but he has a pre-dug hole hidden.

157
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:16,500
And it isn't.

158
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:18,000
You've got it.

159
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:22,000
I can just dig in there. Just go.

160
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,500
This is a good place for me.

161
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:30,500
I agree. Under this rock.

162
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:33,000
Huh, show me that place.

163
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Well dig into this.

164
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:37,500
Fuck this.

165
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:39,500
Take your time.

166
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,500
Hey, a second and a half.

167
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:49,000
After all, there is something.

168
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,500
It really is.

169
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:52,500
I sit on a rock just to be sure.

170
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:54,500
Good, try to leave now.

171
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:08,500
So you trapped the antlion.

172
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:10,000
Little sells.

173
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,500
I'm left.

174
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:13,000
Did you follow us last night?

175
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,500
That's fine.

176
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:16,000
Have you told others?

177
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,500
Silly, but next time wake me up too.

178
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:21,500
Or languages, for that matter.

179
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:23,500
Is that what you mean?

180
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:26,000
You wake me up because I'm nice.

181
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Come on, that's a different matter of course.

182
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Hey, turn off the water.

183
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,500
The hat is not visible here.

184
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:50,500
You can't really see it.

185
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:53,000
Where did you last use it?

186
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
How much water?

187
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,500
I think the sand has turned to water.

188
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:01,500
You'd think the leech lion had already turned into something.

189
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:03,500
You would think so.

190
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:06,000
I've sat enough, jump away.

191
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,500
You can't move a stone on your own, can you?

192
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:13,500
Do we have to help him up?

193
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:15,500
This is disgusting.

194
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:17,500
I'll get it done.

195
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:22,500
What has happened to him?

196
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:24,500
Let's turn the hat upside down.

197
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:26,500
Languages of life!

198
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:34,500
Jelly.

199
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:54,500
Shape, see?

200
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:00,000
What chocolat?

201
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:02,500
It's poop.

202
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:05,500
Hahahaha!

203
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:25,500
Tasteless Peikko!

204
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:31,500
Don't push!

205
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:33,500
Hahahaha!

206
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:00,500
I just saw a magician.

207
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:02,500
What?

208
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:03,500
It must have been him.

209
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:05,500
Are you looking for your top hat?

210
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:07,500
I fear the worst.

211
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:09,500
Did you hide it well?

212
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:11,500
To the basement?

213
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:13,500
Is it a safe hide?

214
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:17,500
Only me and Myy alone know where the hat is.

215
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:28,500
A piece of yarn.

216
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:33,500
It could even turn into spaghetti.

217
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:51,500
It wasn't exactly spaghetti.

218
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:54,500
Mumimamma!

219
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:59,500
Grandma, you should know one thing.

220
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:01,500
What thing?

221
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:03,500
Something is happening in the house.

222
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:05,500
In our house?

223
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:07,500
A tree grows in the basement!

224
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:09,500
Well, it's fun.

225
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:15,500
What the hell have you done?

226
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:19,500
I just put a piece of thread on the magician's hat.

227
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:21,500
We threw the hat away.

228
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:24,500
We retrieved it and took it to the basement.

229
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:26,500
Who are we?

230
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:30,500
Me and Moomin are growing up beautifully.

231
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:35,500
We need to tell Moomipapa before it's too late.

232
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:41,500
In. The door is not locked.

233
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:47,500
Don't worry, just keep growing.

234
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:51,500
Jukkara that I became a green thumb too.

235
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:59,500
Sanokku, you need water and make Piani fruits.

236
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:04,500
In.

237
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:06,500
Sorry to bother you.

238
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:08,500
What's the matter?

239
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:10,500
Sad news.

240
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:12,500
Or bad news?

241
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:15,500
I think you need to connect.

242
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:22,500
I think you should come down and take a look before it's too late.

243
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:25,500
Too late? Sounds threatening.

244
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:29,500
But don't worry, I'll take care of you.

245
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:32,500
Come on Grandma.

246
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:37,500
Leave my husband's desk alone, you hear?

247
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:40,500
I'll come my darling.

248
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:43,500
Oh!

249
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:47,500
Would you bring me a saw? This is truly a disaster.

250
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:54,500
Unfortunately. The thing is, the saw is in the basement and you can't get there.

251
00:15:55,500 --> 00:16:00,500
Back to nature then. I break the branches in my hands.

252
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:12,500
Moomin house.

253
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:15,500
Come on Miss Nisku. This is funny.

254
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:17,500
But what has happened?

255
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:21,500
I've only taken care of the wood shark. Change.

256
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:24,500
Ilua.

257
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:32,500
Disasters shouldn't last this long.

258
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:35,500
I want something from the morning.

259
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:40,500
There is a bright side to this. We no longer need to fetch firewood.

260
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:45,500
Yes, you still learn that you don't take over the Moomin house like that.

261
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:53,500
Moominpa, Moominpa, look at the flowers.

262
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:59,500
Oh, and fruit.

263
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:03,500
Moominpappa, take and taste.

264
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:11,500
Kamala.

265
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:15,500
Pikkumyu has put something in Takuu's hat.

266
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:23,500
Moomin, where are you?

267
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:25,500
I am Finland.

268
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:29,500
Moomin, where are you?

269
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:32,500
Low-no-go.

270
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:36,500
Oh Moomin, I was afraid you weren't in.

271
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:39,500
Dad, mom, sell.

272
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:42,500
We need to get saws and axes.

273
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:46,500
Saat and the axes are in the basement, and there is no going there.

274
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:51,500
I run to get help. You don't have to.

275
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:59,500
Are you a magician?

276
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:03,500
I am. I see you have found my hat.

277
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:06,500
It was on top of a mountain.

278
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:11,500
A remarkable thing. I give thanks that the oin of the tree flourishes.

279
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:18,500
But you must wither away.

280
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:27,500
Mother!

281
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:51,500
Mr. Magician, you have quite a hat.

282
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:54,500
That's right, I apologize.

283
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:58,500
We are thankful that we were saved.

284
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:01,500
Kindly said ma'am.

285
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:05,500
Have you ever seen unusually large rubies?

286
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:09,500
The fact that my hat landed here feels like an omen.

287
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:15,500
Here you are? My husband has gifted it to me.

288
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:19,500
It's really great.

289
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:23,500
However, it's not the king ruby I'm looking for.

290
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:25,500
King ruby?

291
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:28,500
I've been looking for it for hundreds of years.

292
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:32,500
It haunts me and I can't find it.

293
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:35,500
We light a beacon if we see it.

294
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:40,500
I think it's friendly that we meet again.

295
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:43,500
Not even a madder magician.

296
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:50,500
Hey, let's start spinning firewood.

297
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:52,500
Clear!

298
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:55,500
From the branches!

299
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:12,500
Oh!

300
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:22,500
So the magician's hat finally disappeared from the Moomin trap.

301
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:25,500
Moomin's parents were happy with it, but

302
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:30,500
Moomin needed an inexhaustible supply of baby juice.
