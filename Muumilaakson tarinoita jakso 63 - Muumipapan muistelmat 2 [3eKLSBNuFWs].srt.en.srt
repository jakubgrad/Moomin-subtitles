1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
The temperature in Moominvalley is usually sub-zero, but sometimes it gets too hot.

2
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
The Moomin troll is coming!

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Let's dive marshmallow lady!

4
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Wow! Or did you think they could leave without me?

5
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Glad you noticed the note on its door.

6
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Why didn't you tell me you were going to the beach? It took me an hour!

7
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Sorry my, papa decided to leave suddenly.

8
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Snap decisions are disgusting.

9
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I know, I know, but when I went to write my memoirs in the morning, not a single thought flashed into my head.

10
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Of course, this rarely happens, but then the only salvation is to go to the sea.

11
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:10,000
The sea soothes and reminds me of the adventures of my youth.

12
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Continue the story you started.

13
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Do you want to hear?

14
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,000
I think it's fun to figure out what's true and what's false.

15
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
What do you mean? It's all true!

16
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
All true, sweetie!

17
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Except for minor details.

18
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Tell me more!

19
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Oh tell me!

20
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Can I hear too?

21
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Well, if everyone wants to.

22
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Hurrah!

23
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,000
I don't object, even though there is no one like me in the memoirs.

24
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
This time there is a small sale.

25
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Is there?

26
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:53,000
There is. This happened a day after I had foolishly saved Torpokodi with the headmistress.

27
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Sting and burn! The day is half over! Up, up!

28
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Wake up lazy, Jaakko! Up, hosuli, now!

29
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Don't freak out!

30
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Now you can forget all your troubles, because I will take care of you and the ship.

31
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Look how outrageous the cover is.

32
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
You are hogging it to the customer.

33
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Listen.

34
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
What? Are you talking to me?

35
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:29,000
The cover is not dirty, it has a protective layer.

36
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Bosh! Don't try to deceive me?

37
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Bosh!

38
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Bosh!

39
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Bosh!

40
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Bosh!

41
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Bosh!

42
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Bosh!

43
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Bosh!

44
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Bosh!

45
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Bosh!

46
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Bosh!

47
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Bosh!

48
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Bosh!

49
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Bosh!

50
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Bosh!

51
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Bosh!

52
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Bosh!

53
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Bosh!

54
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Bosh!

55
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Bosh!

56
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Bosh!

57
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Bosh!

58
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Bosh!

59
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Bosh!

60
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Bosh!

61
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Bosh!

62
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Bosh!

63
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Bosh!

64
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Bosh!

65
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Bosh!

66
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Bosh!

67
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Bosh!

68
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Bosh!

69
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Bosh!

70
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Bosh!

71
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Bosh!

72
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Bosh!

73
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Bosh!

74
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Bosh!

75
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Bosh!

76
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Bosh!

77
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Bosh!

78
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
likely mechanism

79
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,200
Yes

80
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:15,780
you guys

81
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
J great

82
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
pala

83
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,300
stay

84
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:23,220
And no hiccups, and no trouble cooking.

85
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:25,220
Come down!

86
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:32,300
You are cooking the ones, go away!

87
00:03:32,380 --> 00:03:36,220
Number 13 is about to start, stop!

88
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:43,620
Get your sticky paws off my shirt!

89
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:45,620
Where are you taking me!

90
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:48,540
Disconnect, disconnect and apologize immediately!

91
00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:50,540
Rude behavior!

92
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:53,540
Great women, no fear!

93
00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:57,540
After all, I am the headmistress of the LÃ¶yska orphanage.

94
00:03:57,620 --> 00:03:59,540
Did you hear?

95
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:04,540
Aren't you going to save him, Moomin?

96
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:08,540
Everyone has to look fate in the eye at some point.

97
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:10,540
Wise talk.

98
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:15,540
But maybe, on the contrary, sticky paws should be saved from aunt's claws.

99
00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:20,540
How do you, Hosuli Parka, manage to sleep among that scum?

100
00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:23,540
Don't deface my property.

101
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:28,540
Too hard platform. I would like a soft mat.

102
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:32,540
Fredricksson, why do you have a mast but no sail?

103
00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:36,540
I thought a ship should have a mast.

104
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:39,540
I'll definitely be planning an Amphib next.

105
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:41,540
Amphibin?

106
00:04:41,540 --> 00:04:46,460
Amphibin is a craft that moves in air and water and on land.

107
00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:50,460
No, would you rather be an adventurer or an inventor?

108
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:53,460
Well, it's clear to figure it out.

109
00:04:58,460 --> 00:05:01,460
What is this now?

110
00:05:01,540 --> 00:05:04,460
Hosuli, wake up and watch.

111
00:05:04,540 --> 00:05:06,460
What?

112
00:05:06,460 --> 00:05:09,380
I can't see anything.

113
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:13,380
There seems to be something strange in the bow.

114
00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:23,380
Oh well, yeast.

115
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:27,380
What is it? It looks like a cloud. Is it?

116
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:29,380
On.

117
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:32,380
What does it show?

118
00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:35,300
It looks like a cloud. Is it?

119
00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:43,300
This is the softest mattress of my life.

120
00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:47,300
Was it the same cloud that came from the Magician's hat?

121
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:49,300
It must be.

122
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:51,300
Don't bounce.

123
00:05:51,380 --> 00:05:55,300
Something terrible can happen if you fumble that hard.

124
00:05:56,380 --> 00:06:01,300
Don't be afraid, Hosuli. Try it yourself. It feels fun.

125
00:06:03,380 --> 00:06:06,300
What did I say?

126
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:13,300
What the hell. We move.

127
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:15,300
Hey, look.

128
00:06:15,380 --> 00:06:18,300
The situation seems threatening.

129
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:21,300
A severe storm is coming.

130
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:26,300
Because of that, the sticky paws ran away and the cloud...

131
00:06:26,380 --> 00:06:29,300
Prepare for the worst.

132
00:06:32,380 --> 00:06:34,300
Hey!

133
00:06:51,380 --> 00:06:54,300
The machine is too weak.

134
00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:57,220
Help!

135
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:22,220
We are above the waves.

136
00:07:22,220 --> 00:07:25,140
Oh, Huumi, look at the mast.

137
00:07:30,220 --> 00:07:33,140
Frerriksson, the cloud has turned into a sail.

138
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:35,140
What?

139
00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:40,140
I hadn't planned this.

140
00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:44,140
Frerriksson, now you already have an amphibian.

141
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:47,140
I can't believe this is true.

142
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:54,140
Wake up!

143
00:08:06,220 --> 00:08:09,140
Oh, beautiful.

144
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:24,140
Oops, the cloud is tearing.

145
00:08:24,220 --> 00:08:27,140
It took as long as it needed to.

146
00:08:27,220 --> 00:08:29,140
A friendly cloud.

147
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:32,140
Everyone in their own places, we do a forced landing.

148
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:35,140
Hello, land in the rocks!

149
00:08:45,220 --> 00:08:47,140
There!

150
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:51,140
I hope we don't bump into each other. I can't steer.

151
00:08:52,220 --> 00:08:54,140
Hey!

152
00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:06,140
We are going to the mountain.

153
00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:09,140
Don't worry. Hold on.

154
00:09:09,140 --> 00:09:11,060
Hey!

155
00:09:40,140 --> 00:09:43,060
We just managed to land.

156
00:09:55,140 --> 00:09:58,060
Pahtia, Hosuli.

157
00:09:58,140 --> 00:10:00,060
It doesn't work for you.

158
00:10:00,140 --> 00:10:02,060
I'll definitely take the booth.

159
00:10:02,140 --> 00:10:04,060
Jump.

160
00:10:09,140 --> 00:10:11,060
I said it's okay.

161
00:10:11,140 --> 00:10:14,060
What if someone steals my jar for that time?

162
00:10:14,140 --> 00:10:16,060
Who would steal it?

163
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:18,060
Those who live here.

164
00:10:18,140 --> 00:10:20,060
Although hardly.

165
00:10:24,140 --> 00:10:27,060
The island is apparently uninhabited.

166
00:10:27,140 --> 00:10:30,060
Why has a stone wall been built here?

167
00:10:30,140 --> 00:10:33,060
I don't know. I'll have to ask someone in the back.

168
00:10:33,140 --> 00:10:38,060
Sell. Then we met one who had appeared as you.

169
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:40,980
Like me?

170
00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:46,980
Is there someone there?

171
00:10:47,060 --> 00:10:48,980
There is no one at home.

172
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:53,980
Remarkable. So who just answered?

173
00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:58,980
Go your way. This is how you can open the door when mom is gone.

174
00:10:59,060 --> 00:11:00,980
But you already half opened it.

175
00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:03,980
Which girls are you?

176
00:11:04,060 --> 00:11:05,980
Mymmel's daughter.

177
00:11:05,980 --> 00:11:08,900
No wonder he reminded you of Myy.

178
00:11:08,980 --> 00:11:12,900
For she was the mother and almost as small as you.

179
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:14,900
Where is your mother anyway?

180
00:11:14,980 --> 00:11:16,900
He went to the king's feast.

181
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:18,900
What king is that?

182
00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:21,900
Why didn't mommy take you with her?

183
00:11:21,980 --> 00:11:23,900
Because I'm naughty.

184
00:11:23,980 --> 00:11:25,900
Oh how naughty?

185
00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:27,900
I always narrate.

186
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:30,900
You also practiced the fact that there is no one at home.

187
00:11:30,980 --> 00:11:33,900
I can't do anything to my character.

188
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:36,820
You guys look funny. Come join the party.

189
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:39,820
To a party? I've never been to a party.

190
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:42,820
But what does your mother say to that?

191
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:45,820
Remember you told me to stay home.

192
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:48,820
He immediately forgets everything he has said.

193
00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:50,820
Is that a lie too?

194
00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:52,820
What do you say, Hervikson?

195
00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:56,820
Let's just go. I have never met a king before.

196
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:02,820
Do you think we'll get a chance to greet the king?

197
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:04,740
Certainly.

198
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:09,740
Unhappy me. I don't even know how to address the king.

199
00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:11,740
What does he look like?

200
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:15,740
He is terribly old and wrinkled.

201
00:12:15,820 --> 00:12:19,740
I don't imagine the king like that.

202
00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:23,740
Just don't believe a word that girl says.

203
00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:31,740
This is where we enter.

204
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:34,660
What does that sign say?

205
00:12:34,740 --> 00:12:36,660
King's party!

206
00:12:36,740 --> 00:12:40,660
Everyone is welcome to celebrate our 100th anniversary.

207
00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:42,660
A big surprise party.

208
00:12:42,740 --> 00:12:45,660
Don't panic if something happens.

209
00:12:45,740 --> 00:12:47,660
A surprise party.

210
00:12:47,740 --> 00:12:50,660
Don't be scared. Terrible things happen there.

211
00:12:50,740 --> 00:12:53,660
I tell you what. At least it will be fun.

212
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:57,660
Many guests have disappeared completely.

213
00:12:57,660 --> 00:12:59,580
Did you hear that, Moomi?

214
00:12:59,660 --> 00:13:02,580
You said you shouldn't trust the girl.

215
00:13:02,660 --> 00:13:04,580
I'm not sure.

216
00:13:19,660 --> 00:13:22,580
Now he left a little.

217
00:13:23,660 --> 00:13:25,580
Let's run away.

218
00:13:25,660 --> 00:13:27,580
Skinned.

219
00:13:28,660 --> 00:13:33,580
Aha. Just as I thought. Artificial.

220
00:13:35,660 --> 00:13:40,580
The legs are steel springs and the eyes are flashbulbs.

221
00:13:40,660 --> 00:13:42,580
Did you freak out?

222
00:13:42,660 --> 00:13:44,580
Who spoke?

223
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:50,580
Why are you delaying? Hurry up. There is water here.

224
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:54,500
I want to know whose voice it was.

225
00:13:54,580 --> 00:13:57,500
Forget it and paddle carefully forward.

226
00:13:57,580 --> 00:14:00,500
Careful paddling. This doesn't help.

227
00:14:00,580 --> 00:14:03,500
More horrors, eh?

228
00:14:10,580 --> 00:14:12,500
Fountain.

229
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:14,420
Fountain.

230
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:21,420
Now you've passed.

231
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:24,420
Bad voice. Pasta, who are you.

232
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:32,420
How far is the party?

233
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:45,420
Another surprise. Mechanical Bull.

234
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:51,420
Someone thinks that we can get high with just about anything.

235
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:54,420
Who's Afraid of the Mechanical Son?

236
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:04,420
Please wait for me.

237
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:11,420
You didn't expect this.

238
00:15:11,420 --> 00:15:13,340
Who is there?

239
00:15:23,420 --> 00:15:25,340
Hurry up.

240
00:15:25,420 --> 00:15:27,340
Oh poor.

241
00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:32,340
Is there paper pulp?

242
00:15:32,420 --> 00:15:35,340
You're almost there faster.

243
00:15:41,420 --> 00:15:44,340
The sound comes from that horn.

244
00:15:44,420 --> 00:15:46,340
It's a loud sound.

245
00:15:46,420 --> 00:15:48,340
Loud sound.

246
00:15:49,340 --> 00:15:54,260
The scares are now over and the joyful part of our celebration can begin.

247
00:15:54,340 --> 00:15:57,260
The sound comes from that horn.

248
00:15:57,340 --> 00:15:59,260
It's a loud sound.

249
00:15:59,340 --> 00:16:01,260
Loud sound.

250
00:16:11,340 --> 00:16:14,260
The festive fireworks are starting!

251
00:16:18,340 --> 00:16:21,260
The festive fireworks are starting!

252
00:16:29,340 --> 00:16:31,260
Big party.

253
00:16:31,340 --> 00:16:35,260
They are. You will get to many more parties.

254
00:16:35,340 --> 00:16:37,260
Can I have some pie?

255
00:16:37,340 --> 00:16:39,260
Yes, please.

256
00:16:39,340 --> 00:16:41,260
Does the juice taste good too?

257
00:16:41,340 --> 00:16:43,260
Yeah, thanks.

258
00:16:44,340 --> 00:16:47,260
Well girl, show him where your mother is now.

259
00:16:47,260 --> 00:16:49,180
There he is.

260
00:16:49,260 --> 00:16:53,180
That big round one with the same hair cycle as me.

261
00:16:57,260 --> 00:17:00,180
Is that old man with the crown a king?

262
00:17:00,260 --> 00:17:02,180
He just.

263
00:17:02,260 --> 00:17:04,180
I wouldn't believe it.

264
00:17:04,260 --> 00:17:07,180
He is not too precious. Let's stay more distant.

265
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:10,180
Come on, no one here is afraid of the king.

266
00:17:11,260 --> 00:17:13,180
Hey mom!

267
00:17:13,260 --> 00:17:15,180
There you are.

268
00:17:15,180 --> 00:17:17,100
New friends!

269
00:17:17,180 --> 00:17:19,100
They look like new.

270
00:17:19,180 --> 00:17:23,100
Good day your majesty and congratulations on your anniversary.

271
00:17:23,180 --> 00:17:25,100
We come from far across the seas.

272
00:17:25,180 --> 00:17:28,100
I'm Fredikson, I'm an inventor by profession.

273
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:30,100
And this is how...

274
00:17:30,180 --> 00:17:32,100
And you are Moomi, the adventurer.

275
00:17:32,180 --> 00:17:36,100
On the other side is Juxu and that other one must be Hosuli.

276
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:38,100
That voice!

277
00:17:39,180 --> 00:17:43,100
I've been watching you for a while now with a telescope.

278
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:46,020
It was very interesting.

279
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:48,020
But now to more serious matters.

280
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:52,020
We consider you worthy citizens of our kingdom

281
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:57,020
and thus, by royal proclamation, you will remain on our island.

282
00:17:57,100 --> 00:17:59,020
Great honor for us!

283
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:05,020
Hey Fredikson, I already gave the order to move your ship here.

284
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:07,020
Meren huskeenko?

285
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:12,020
Absolutely. I want you to keep inventing in our surprise park.

286
00:18:12,020 --> 00:18:13,940
No crazier.

287
00:18:14,020 --> 00:18:16,940
What about our adventure, Fredikson?

288
00:18:17,020 --> 00:18:19,940
We can go on an adventure whenever we want.

289
00:18:20,020 --> 00:18:21,940
This is how I build the Amphib here.

290
00:18:22,020 --> 00:18:25,940
Moomi, Hosuli and Juxu can settle wherever they want

291
00:18:26,020 --> 00:18:27,940
and build houses for themselves.

292
00:18:28,020 --> 00:18:29,940
Oh, build?

293
00:18:30,020 --> 00:18:32,940
Great declaration isn't it?

294
00:18:34,940 --> 00:18:39,940
That's right people. The grand style celebrations continue.

295
00:18:40,860 --> 00:18:42,900
.

296
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:46,900
.

297
00:18:56,940 --> 00:18:57,940
.

298
00:18:57,940 --> 00:19:05,940
I am I want to get and I am I want to get and I am to get and I am to get.

299
00:19:12,020 --> 00:19:18,900
I built my house by the sea and the sea spray control core became the ground floor.

300
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:21,340
There I lived by myself.

301
00:19:21,340 --> 00:19:23,260
How was Hosul?

302
00:19:23,260 --> 00:19:27,540
Well, of course he was still in the coffee can.

303
00:19:27,540 --> 00:19:30,540
So what happened to you?

304
00:19:30,540 --> 00:19:38,540
Well, after the king owned both the ship and its captain, I couldn't move anymore.

305
00:19:38,540 --> 00:19:40,540
No adventures!

306
00:19:40,540 --> 00:19:41,540
What?

307
00:19:41,540 --> 00:19:43,540
Prolonged living in the house.

308
00:19:43,540 --> 00:19:48,540
You must have been listening with your mouth and not your ears open.

309
00:19:48,540 --> 00:19:53,540
A settled life does not offer any kind of excitement.

310
00:19:54,540 --> 00:20:01,540
But the house was not ordinary. It was haunted houses every night.

311
00:20:01,540 --> 00:20:03,540
Nope.

312
00:20:03,540 --> 00:20:04,540
Tell me about it!

313
00:20:04,540 --> 00:20:08,540
I might not want to hear it next time.

314
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:11,540
Can't stop like that!

315
00:20:11,540 --> 00:20:16,540
Wow, now I feel the call to the horizontal position.

316
00:20:17,540 --> 00:20:24,540
And Moominpappa went to Nokos when he noticed that he had aroused the listeners' interest again.

317
00:20:24,540 --> 00:20:29,540
What's wrong with keeping your audience in suspense?
