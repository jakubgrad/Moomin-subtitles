1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:17,000
In other words, Moomin is in the company of Snoopy these days even more than usual.

2
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Winter would hit Moomin Valley any day now and the friends would have to part ways.

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Moomin would hibernate and Snoopy would wander south.

4
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Hey my, why is your face so horribly sour?

5
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Where exactly are you staying?

6
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
To the lonely mountains.

7
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Why are you two always sneaking somewhere?

8
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Don't talk soft, we're not going anywhere.

9
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:02,000
You're sloppy, you're worse than usual, and you don't care about others.

10
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Are we really like that?

11
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Maybe we are.

12
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Nothing maybe, I say you are very naughty.

13
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
We just go for a walk.

14
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Oh now?

15
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
So.

16
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,000
It's going to snow in the next few days, and then there's nowhere to go.

17
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,000
We would like to create one last look at Moomin Valley before winter.

18
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Visible story.

19
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:31,000
But really, I'm leaving for the south soon and I want to get myself a vivid memory of these regions.

20
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
You know, you hear that.

21
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Oh Moomin, can we come along?

22
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Of course not.

23
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:47,000
It just occurred to me that you two are hatching some conspiracies again.

24
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Nipsu, don't bother.

25
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,000
You know that snuff Muikkunen disappears for months.

26
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
We have a lot to talk about.

27
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Let it be then, let's go.

28
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Here is a fun view in the middle of winter.

29
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
All in white.

30
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Pretty for sure.

31
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
I doubt it.

32
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Well, of course it's beautiful.

33
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
It's beautiful in summer.

34
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:21,000
I must get here in the winter, for sure.

35
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
You can't, you're hibernating.

36
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
That's true.

37
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
But this winter I'm trying to stay awake.

38
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Just like Moomin and me last winter.

39
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
So.

40
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
You can't do that.

41
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Moomin, what are you going to do?

42
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,000
I don't miss snow and frost, I'm hibernating.

43
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Let's go home, I've seen enough.

44
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Sell, we didn't ask you to join.

45
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Listen Nipsu, let's go back to the lake where the goldfish was.

46
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
No, no, that's too far.

47
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Ha, you're afraid of that forest, Nipsu.

48
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
And please, I'm not afraid.

49
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Look who's over there?

50
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
I don't know him.

51
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
What are you doing here?

52
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Well, sitting.

53
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Don't be silly, Nipsu.

54
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Well hello.

55
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Hello, hello.

56
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Hello, hello.

57
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Why are you sitting there?

58
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
I'm waiting.

59
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Who?

60
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Grandma.

61
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
So far.

62
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Grandma told me to wait by the big rock on the lonely path to the mountains.

63
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
But there are other rocks along the path.

64
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Is there?

65
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,000
I have only seen this.

66
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Now watch Grandma while I make you wait here.

67
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Grandma's cabin is in the forest and it's hard to find it.

68
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Or in the forest?

69
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Wait, I mean that forest.

70
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
I'm not quite sure.

71
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
There are witches in the forest.

72
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
How long have you been waiting?

73
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
About an hour.

74
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Grandma, you are not regular.

75
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Maybe I came early.

76
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Well, that's how you came.

77
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Hi grandma.

78
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Welcome, Alisa.

79
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Who are these kids anyway?

80
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:31,000
While I was sitting here alone, they passed by and aimed to help me.

81
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Just thanks, it was nicely done.

82
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
It was friendly.

83
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Shall we go?

84
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
We heard that Täti lives in the forest.

85
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
I live.

86
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Where there?

87
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Come on, don't you, I live right in the middle of the forest.

88
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Really.

89
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,000
I only know an old cabin there, where witches supposedly lived.

90
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Or like that.

91
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Share share, that's my cabin.

92
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
The girl's grandmother is...

93
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
...I guess witches.

94
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
But there are no witches.

95
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
I guess there are.

96
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Well, at least grandma doesn't look like a bad witch.

97
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Appearances can be deceiving.

98
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:35,000
That nice girl can't have a mean grandma.

99
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Yes, we hope so.

100
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Why do you think grandma is a witch?

101
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Who would live in the forest?

102
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,000
No matter who, I can't think of anyone else.

103
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,000
I feel in my skin that grandma is a witch.

104
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:54,000
And thus the pretty girl is the witch's grandchild.

105
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Ugh, that's right.

106
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
In.

107
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Nisku, prepare food.

108
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
I'll come right away.

109
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,000
No wonder it's so bright. Full moon.

110
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Miss Nisku, you'd better move into the Moomin house tonight.

111
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
For what the hell?

112
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,000
I'm not going to hibernate because of my career.

113
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
But Nisku...

114
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:29,000
I need to finish the Blueprint of my new aircraft.

115
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:35,000
My first aircraft was still plagued by children's diseases, but this one will be perfect.

116
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,000
The new round shape excites me.

117
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Nisku-dear, you know you need hibernation.

118
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
I'm supervising.

119
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:47,000
All right. I'm going to hibernate with the Moomins.

120
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Clear. Shall we go to eat?

121
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Just leave your sister. We notice all the mokomi.

122
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Thank you very much.

123
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:11,000
It's also fun for Moomin. He gets company.

124
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Joo.

125
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Well, honey, you can't socialize while you're sleeping.

126
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,000
It's much more fun when someone else sleeps in the same room.

127
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,000
When do we hibernate?

128
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,000
In a few days if this weather continues.

129
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Soon?

130
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Snow will be on the ground before the weekend.

131
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Nisku, good luck with the new blue copies. I hope they will be ready by spring.

132
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Yes, they will graduate. Next year at this time I will be flying.

133
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Thank you for taking care of my inner rest.

134
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Small trouble.

135
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Good night.

136
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Have a good winter.

137
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Sweet dreams, little girl.

138
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Good luck with your work.

139
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Well, I finally have the opportunity to delve deeper into design work.

140
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Yes?

141
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
I can't believe my eyes.

142
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
I see delusions.

143
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:43,000
A witch rides on a broomstick.

144
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:51,000
When Nisku gets something on his mind, there is no room for anything else in his mind.

145
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
I have a hunch that it will work out now.

146
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,000
That round tractor in my dream flew beautifully.

147
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:03,000
I often dream of flying, but when I'm awake I don't dream about airline companies,

148
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Nisku has a new idea.

149
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Low?

150
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
What is it?

151
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Ajajajajaja, it's mine!

152
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Have you seen again?

153
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
It laughed at me.

154
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Who laughed?

155
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,000
It flew on a broom without an engine.

156
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Are you talking about a witch?

157
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,000
I worked for nothing if flying is so easy.

158
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Don't be discouraged.

159
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Did you see the witch?

160
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Thus.

161
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Where?

162
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Very close.

163
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Nisku, I don't see anything like that.

164
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Only the moon shines in the sky.

165
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Was it really flying in the sky?

166
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Nisku, I don't see anything like that.

167
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Only the moon shines in the sky.

168
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Only the moon shines in the sky.

169
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Only the moon shines in the sky.

170
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Only the moon shines in the sky.

171
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Witch in the sky now.

172
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Nisku knows what flies and what doesn't.

173
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:23,000
At least I won't believe it until I see it with my own eyes.

174
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Sniff me, if that old granny is a real witch, then what kind of girl is she?

175
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,000
A witch's child's child is, of course, a witch.

176
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:36,000
I don't believe it. A girl can be an adopted child.

177
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,000
We need to get to the bottom of it.

178
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
It is.

179
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Up.

180
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:52,000
And again you are red-handed.

181
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Where are you sneaking off to?

182
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Sell, you can't come today.

183
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
And why?

184
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Because we have no idea what dangers lie ahead.

185
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Aha, then I have to come along to watch that you guys don't get into trouble.

186
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Nothing exciting has happened to me since kite flying.

187
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,000
I can't resist adventures.

188
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
I have come up with a plan.

189
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:25,000
I'll bite the witch and while she's in a helpless state teasing the girl.

190
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Nothing crazy, but we don't know if grandma is a witch.

191
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Wouldn't it be pretty embarrassing for you too to bite an ordinary grandma?

192
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Maybe the witch needs a lost girl for some of her horrible magic tricks.

193
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Let's find out.

194
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
So in what way?

195
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
I don't know yet.

196
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:47,000
I hope you come up with something before we get there.

197
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Let's hide as close to the cabin as possible and then ask the girl out.

198
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,000
What if he doesn't come?

199
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
No, sitten me improvisoimme.

200
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Ha, snuff has different labels.

201
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:06,000
If the girl doesn't come out, we boldly go and knock on the door.

202
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Once we get inside, we will see what the truth is.

203
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:16,000
What would you say to that? What if the witch cast a spell on us?

204
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:21,000
If we don't start hearing, the little girl will run to Moomin Valley to get help.

205
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:25,000
No, no, the Moomins can do it. I explored the cabin.

206
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,000
It won't even be heard. I'll examine the cabin, sell it.

207
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Sell, why can't we make it so that you are left out and if we get stuck, you try to free us and when necessary, seek help.

208
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,000
So you would put your life in my hands.

209
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
You would be our last hope.

210
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:47,000
I don't like the idea that the little one is my last hope.

211
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,000
I don't help anyone who doesn't trust me.

212
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Well, that's what you saw.

213
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Shh, shut up.

214
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
There.

215
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Very quiet. Is there anyone at home?

216
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Let's wait a while and see.

217
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Do we have to stand and stare at this?

218
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
That's fine.

219
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,000
After all, it's a piece of cake if the cottage is empty.

220
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Where have Moomin and snuff Muikkunen gone?

221
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:25,000
I don't care much and the little one is with them.

222
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
The seller let us down.

223
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:30,000
I can guess where they went.

224
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Ah, you guess? Well where, where have they gone?

225
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
To the forest, of course.

226
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Yes?

227
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Looks like you met the right witch for us.

228
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
It wasn't right.

229
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Sent to see.

230
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,000
I'm pretty sure I know how to get those in the woods.

231
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
To, to.

232
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
What now?

233
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Ouch, ouch, ouch, sick to my stomach.

234
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Oh, oh, I can't leave. Ouch, ouch, ouch, ouch.

235
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,000
How long are we still waiting for?

236
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Uh, this isn't exciting at all.

237
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Let's wait a little while longer.

238
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,000
At least we will know if grandma is home.

239
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Uh, he's on business somewhere.

240
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,000
It is very possible.

241
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
He goes to the well.

242
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,000
He keeps the girl as his slave.

243
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Sell, where are you going?

244
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Sell follows a girl.

245
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Go along and find out what you get.

246
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:36,000
I'll stay guarding the cabin.

247
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
All right.

248
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,000
No Myy waits.

249
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
All right.

250
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
All right.

251
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,000
No, look, get a haircut today.

252
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Wait.

253
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
I haven't done anything.

254
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Then why are you running away?

255
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
I will help you.

256
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
And me!

257
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Thanks. It is light to carry in three beds.

258
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,000
Your name is Alisa.

259
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:26,000
That's right, glad you remembered that.

260
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,000
I'm a Moomin troll.

261
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,000
And I Sell!

262
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
What are you here for?

263
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Well actually we came because we were worried about you.

264
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Worried about me?

265
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Is that old man your grandma?

266
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,000
On.

267
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Are you sure?

268
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,000
I am. She is my mother's mother. Why do you ask?

269
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Well, when that...

270
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
Moomin would like to ask...

271
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
What?

272
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Is your grandma a witch?

273
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
On, on.

274
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
I'm smitten.

275
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:00,000
It doesn't bother you at all that your grandma is a witch?

276
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,000
Oh no. He is what he is.

277
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:06,000
One day I will become a witch too.

278
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:10,000
Hard to imagine. You don't look like a witch.

279
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
I'm not a witch yet.

280
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,000
But if you are born into a witch family, you become a witch.

281
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
It does require studying.

282
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
Goes beyond understanding.

283
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Aunt doesn't sound like a witch.

284
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:24,000
So what should a witch sound like?

285
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,000
To be honest, I have never met a witch before.

286
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:30,000
As a passport, you are simple.

287
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Is that pretty girl really auntie's grandchild?

288
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:36,000
Sa hear, promising girl.

289
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:41,000
Honest and hardworking, she will make a great witch if she obeys me.

290
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:44,000
How does a sweet girl become a witch?

291
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
I didn't know you were home already.

292
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Good thing you fetched water.

293
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,000
Who is it?

294
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:55,000
This simple chap has undoubtedly come to your rescue.

295
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Oh, you're Nuuska Muikkunen.

296
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,000
I am.

297
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Nuuska Muikkunen is here. Please come in.

298
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
Is Nuuska in Muikkunen's cabin?

299
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,000
On.

300
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
Muuska Muikkunen is here.

301
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:12,000
Muuska Muikkunen is here. Please come in.

302
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
Is Nuuska in Muikkunen's cabin?

303
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Oh, he's got company.

304
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:20,000
Oh, Nuuska Muikkunen, what has been done to you?

305
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,000
I'll open the rope.

306
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Wait, I'll do it.

307
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,000
This is small.

308
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Huh, that was tough.

309
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,000
Hey, don't run away, I still need you.

310
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
Kärme freaked out when it was bitten.

311
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,000
Yes, yes.

312
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:42,000
By the way, what are you doing here?

313
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:46,000
They've come all the way from Moomin Valley to check that I'm okay.

314
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,000
So far away.

315
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:52,000
They came to save me from your clutches if you mistreat me.

316
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
Oh yes, it can be done.

317
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Witches are thought not to be honorable citizens.

318
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
We apologize.

319
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:09,000
Nuuska Muikkunen, Alisa said that she wants to visit us in Moomin Valley soon.

320
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
He is welcome.

321
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:14,000
Have you gone to promise one?

322
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:19,000
I thought I'd drop by Moomin once in a while after I've done my homework first.

323
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:22,000
I don't want to neglect my studies.

324
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:28,000
Oh oh, but if you want to become a good witch, you must not meet ordinary mortals.

325
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
Oh, what a shame.

326
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,000
Just when we had time to become friends.

327
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:37,000
If only I started those studies next year.

328
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
Alisa!

329
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,000
This is a family matter.

330
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:50,000
If you don't mind, I would ask you to leave.

331
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
Snow!

332
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:08,000
Alisa won't be able to see us when Moomin Valley is covered under a blanket of snow again.

333
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,000
No.

334
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:13,000
Yes, and the snot, they're going south.

335
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:18,000
Winter is coming to Moomin Valley again.
