1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Have you heard of Moomin Valley?

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
In winter, it sleeps deep in cinemas.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:16,000
You see, all rational beings fall into hibernation as soon as Moomin Valley is covered in a blanket of snow.

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
This is the Moomin House.

5
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Do you notice? They are reasonable people.

6
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Here is Moomin, the hero of our story.

7
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
This is Moominpapa.

8
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
And this Moominma.

9
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Oh, and this vekkul is so small that it must be a small one.

10
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
You never know who you'll find sleeping in Moomin House.

11
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
But now it's time to start the story.

12
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
However, it can get boring if everyone is asleep.

13
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Don't you want to jump straight into spring?

14
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Spring. Spring has come.

15
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Hi everyone! Hello, it's spring!

16
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Moomin!

17
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Oh, are you awake too?

18
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Who can sleep when you wake up?

19
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
I shouted from Riemu.

20
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Say one thing.

21
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Well what?

22
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Do you find it fun to wake others up?

23
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Of course.

24
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
I just dreamed that I lived in a watermelon.

25
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
You have to get up, the sun is shining.

26
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
What's so amazing about that?

27
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Winter is over, spring has come and life is wonderful.

28
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Sleeping is wonderful too.

29
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,000
You told us to wake you up on the first day of spring.

30
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Did I order?

31
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Don't you remember?

32
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Well, pretty casually.

33
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,000
You can go back to sleep if you want.

34
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
However, I can't sleep anymore.

35
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
There you see.

36
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Mother!

37
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Happy spring, Moomin troll.

38
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Moomin mom, I'm hungry.

39
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Do you have watermelon?

40
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
No, but much more.

41
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Let's prepare a really sumptuous breakfast.

42
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Nuuska Muikkunen is back.

43
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
You can get there faster along the highways.

44
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
It wouldn't be half as much fun.

45
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Are you going to leave your house?

46
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Oh yes, it was fun to spend the winter at your place.

47
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Your sister hasn't come back yet.

48
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
I'm still going!

49
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Sniff, little one!

50
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Hello Moomin troll.

51
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
You came back early this year.

52
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Could be.

53
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Wasn't your trip fun?

54
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
That was it.

55
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
But I sensed that spring had already come.

56
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Tell me about your trip.

57
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Sometimes the Moomin of others.

58
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Let's go wake up Nipsu and do something special.

59
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Nipsu doesn't like to be woken up.

60
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
I hear snoring.

61
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Let's whistle one more time.

62
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
The snoring stopped.

63
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Dude, come out.

64
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Nuuska Muikkunen is here.

65
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
I want to sleep.

66
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
We are going to do something special.

67
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Oh special?

68
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Maybe by this year.

69
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
I want to sleep.

70
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
I want to sleep.

71
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Maybe climbing this mountain is special.

72
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,000
We can be the first to climb to the top.

73
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
I saw it on a cloudless day.

74
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:05,000
The whole Moomin valley should be visible from the top.

75
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Good morning.

76
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Good morning? Are parents following?

77
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Mom was there when I left.

78
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Yes.

79
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
A strange way to hibernate.

80
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
We enjoy it.

81
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Why do you always have to do something special?

82
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Beautiful.

83
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Not a great view at all.

84
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Smoke rises from the chimney of the Moomin house.

85
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Mummy Moomin is cooking something delicious.

86
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
What?

87
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Someone has been here before us.

88
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Look.

89
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Silencers.

90
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Big and black.

91
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Could it be anyone's?

92
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Dad could use it on Sundays.

93
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Page.

94
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Pretty much bigger than me.

95
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Do you see?

96
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
It's hard to see the point of this.

97
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Even deeper.

98
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,000
My hat is better.

99
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
What is it?

100
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,000
The hat feels shrunk.

101
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
I'm not pulling it off.

102
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Autan.

103
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
The voice is swollen.

104
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
What is it?

105
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,000
The hat got stuck on the father's head.

106
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,000
The old hat is indeed stylish.

107
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
This hat is not mine.

108
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
The kids found it.

109
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
It's beautiful.

110
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
What do we do about it?

111
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
I don't like the whole hat.

112
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Throw away?

113
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
That would be a shame.

114
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Do you know someone big enough?

115
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
In.

116
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
It's good for this.

117
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Or into a trash can?

118
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Well guessed Nuuska Muikkunen.

119
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Let's have breakfast now.

120
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Come to the table too, Nuuska Muikkunen.

121
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Lovely smell.

122
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,000
See you out with Moomin.

123
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Will you come along?

124
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Or do you prefer to stay here?

125
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,000
What, are you going to spend?

126
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
You will present the future?

127
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Moisture.

128
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Now it's almost ready.

129
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:00,000
This year, my flight deck is finally finished.

130
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
No.

131
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Needs finishing.

132
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Is it even possible to build an airplane?

133
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Well, of course it isn't.

134
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Niisku has dreamed of building one.

135
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
You can always dream.

136
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:28,000
I settled for more modest dreams.

137
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
So do I.

138
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Do you ever stop eating?

139
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,000
I guess you're not dreaming about anything.

140
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Sure, I dream of an empty pantry.

141
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Who here has eaten eggs?

142
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:58,000
It's good that there is finally a trash can.

143
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,000
What are the young people now?

144
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
They look like clouds.

145
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Do not touch, they may be poisoned.

146
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
I'm floating.

147
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Lovely.

148
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
I want too.

149
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Are you comfortable with it?

150
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
I want too.

151
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
I want too.

152
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Are you comfortable with it?

153
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
We went.

154
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
What if you fall?

155
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:13,000
What if the clouds rise right up and someone falls?

156
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Long cloud.

157
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Wait, wait cloud.

158
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
I'm falling, I'm falling

159
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Moominpappa is writing his memoirs.

160
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:41,000
An awful lot of everything has happened to him.

161
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Memoirs become unusually extensive.

162
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Yes?

163
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Sky.

164
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Moomin troll.

165
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
What the hell are you doing?

166
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:06,000
I'm flying, these clouds just came out of the house.

167
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Come closer.

168
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
I will save you.

169
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
You don't have to.

170
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Wait, stop.

171
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Dad, hop on board.

172
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
On my dare.

173
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Jump or fall.

174
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Too late.

175
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Mom, emergency.

176
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Well, now what?

177
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
You know what kids do?

178
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
I know.

179
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
They sail on the clouds, see.

180
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:45,000
I told them to be careful not to fall out.

181
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Pinch, are you ready?

182
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
I can.

183
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Wait, cloud, come back.

184
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,000
I'll be nice now, don't move.

185
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
That's right.

186
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Right in your fields, cloud.

187
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
What?

188
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
We play together again, cloud.

189
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Come, come, come here.

190
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
What, a cloud?

191
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
My cloud is shrinking.

192
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Blacksmithing was fun.

193
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Yes, but I haven't finished yet.

194
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Are Moomin and Ladybug there?

195
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Hey hey.

196
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Their clouds last longer.

197
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
But they are also dwindling.

198
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
They would come down already.

199
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Hoi!

200
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
I'm starting to count.

201
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
One.

202
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
All.

203
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Do you want something?

204
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Good hiding place.

205
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Are there any good hiding places here?

206
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
This is where you can find me.

207
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Come, come here.

208
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Come, come here.

209
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
But!

210
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Yes, Moomin must be in the house.

211
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
I saw Moomin crawling into the fireplace.

212
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
Did you find it?

213
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
In.

214
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Looking from the basement?

215
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Of course.

216
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Did someone just laugh?

217
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Cry?

218
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
I have to go home.

219
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Is something wrong?

220
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
There is. I still haven't found it.

221
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
There is. I still haven't found a Moomin.

222
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
He is so thick that there is no good hiding place.

223
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
He is so thick that there is no good hiding place.

224
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
Hey, there's laughter over there.

225
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Here I am.

226
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Let's imagine I'm the only one who wasn't found.

227
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Let's imagine I'm the only one who wasn't found.

228
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
who are you

229
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
You don't know me do you?

230
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
You tried hard.

231
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
And you didn't find.

232
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Please introduce yourself.

233
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Please introduce yourself.

234
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Or so? Is this some new game?

235
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Or so? Is this some new game?

236
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
I'm a swamp lady, what about you?

237
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
I'm a swamp lady, what about you?

238
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Well, I'm the king of Moominvalley.

239
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Well, I'm the king of Moominvalley.

240
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
You are too ugly to be king.

241
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
That was unkindly said.

242
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
That was unkindly said.

243
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Wasn't it the father?

244
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
Do you know where Moomin hides?

245
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
Here he is.

246
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
Where?

247
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
Well, here.

248
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Now you get permission to tell who you really are.

249
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
Father?

250
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
I'm not your father.

251
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
You are. I'm a Moomin.

252
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Moomin is kind and funny looking.

253
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Moomin is kind and funny looking.

254
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Not like you.

255
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Have you looked in the mirror?

256
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
What does this mean?

257
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
What does this mean?

258
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
My entire muzzle is gone.

259
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
No!

260
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
I'm hairy all over and...

261
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
My tail is now thick.

262
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
I had a dream.

263
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
This cannot be true.

264
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
This is too horrible.

265
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
This is too horrible.

266
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
What do you shout with?

267
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
What has happened?

268
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
Go!

269
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
Go!

270
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
What on earth?

271
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
He claims to be a Moomin.

272
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Is this my moomin baby?

273
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
Is this my moomin baby?

274
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
It's me.

275
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
I really am a Moomin.

276
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
Are you a believer?

277
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
are you

278
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:40,000
I guess I've changed somehow.

279
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
Calm down, calm down.

280
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
Yes, this will work out.

281
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
You have nothing to worry about,

282
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
if you really are a Moomin.

283
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
Say I'm a Moomin.

284
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
Healthy if.

285
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
Say you know me already.

286
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
I don't know what you think about this,

287
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
but i'm me

288
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
Mom say I'm your very own Moomin.

289
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
I'm a Moomin.

290
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
Say it, mom.

291
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
Say it, mom.

292
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
Don't I know my own child?

293
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
Mother.

294
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:32,000
You really are my own Moomin child.

295
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
Hi mom.

296
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
Kite.

297
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
Oh, Moomin.

298
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
Father.

299
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
Moomin stocking,

300
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
where did you hide?

301
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
To the hat.

302
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
Better get rid of the hat.

303
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:18,000
Because everyone wanted to keep the way they were,

304
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
it was decided to throw the hat away.

305
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:24,000
However, Moomin was not unreservedly satisfied.

306
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:28,000
You don't find a hat like that every day.
