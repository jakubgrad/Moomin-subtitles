1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,940
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight,

2
00:00:16,940 --> 00:00:25,940
One, two, two, three, four, five, six, seven, two.

3
00:00:25,940 --> 00:00:30,940
It's a beautiful day in Muunilaakso. Mild but not too hot.

4
00:00:30,940 --> 00:00:33,940
It has been decided to eat lunch outside.

5
00:00:33,940 --> 00:00:36,940
Kids, the food is ready!

6
00:00:36,940 --> 00:00:38,940
Seventeen.

7
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:40,940
GP!

8
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:51,940
Moomin's pancakes are good.

9
00:00:51,940 --> 00:00:53,940
Thank you for your courtesy.

10
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:58,940
I'm addicted to pancakes. We always have them.

11
00:00:58,940 --> 00:01:02,940
Yes, but you seem to like it.

12
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:04,940
Pancakes always taste good.

13
00:01:04,940 --> 00:01:07,940
I didn't say pancakes are bad.

14
00:01:07,940 --> 00:01:12,940
But it would be fun to eat a new dish once in a while, wouldn't it, Moomin papa?

15
00:01:12,940 --> 00:01:14,940
That...

16
00:01:14,940 --> 00:01:16,940
Dad doesn't need a change.

17
00:01:16,940 --> 00:01:20,940
He got to eat enough foreign foods on his adventure trips.

18
00:01:20,940 --> 00:01:22,940
For example, what?

19
00:01:22,940 --> 00:01:26,940
Grilled monsters as fokonas! Mushroom with jelly!

20
00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:28,940
Oops! did you eat

21
00:01:28,940 --> 00:01:31,940
No, I don't. Nothing of the kind.

22
00:01:31,940 --> 00:01:33,940
Tell me about a dish.

23
00:01:33,940 --> 00:01:35,940
Joo...

24
00:01:35,940 --> 00:01:38,940
Once I really ate a special treat.

25
00:01:38,940 --> 00:01:40,940
Do not! How did it taste?

26
00:01:40,940 --> 00:01:43,940
It was the most wonderful food in the world.

27
00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:49,940
Although, of course, not about the taxes on mamma's soups.

28
00:01:49,940 --> 00:01:51,940
Tell me what it was.

29
00:01:51,940 --> 00:01:53,940
Mouthpiece!

30
00:01:53,940 --> 00:01:55,940
You are also interested in food.

31
00:01:55,940 --> 00:01:58,940
No kids, let's stop talking about food.

32
00:02:06,940 --> 00:02:09,940
No, no, no red for heaven's sake!

33
00:02:09,940 --> 00:02:11,940
I think it's a beautiful color!

34
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:16,940
Kids, are you up yet?

35
00:02:16,940 --> 00:02:18,940
It's not too late.

36
00:02:18,940 --> 00:02:20,940
Right, I thought...

37
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:24,940
Mamma Honey, what's wrong with you?

38
00:02:24,940 --> 00:02:27,940
Ah, I was just in my thoughts.

39
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:30,940
Turn off the lights when you go to rest.

40
00:02:30,940 --> 00:02:33,940
Yeah, good night.

41
00:02:36,940 --> 00:02:38,940
Mummy has worries!

42
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:40,940
What exactly do you mean?

43
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:44,940
Mumipappahan said that he once ate the best food in the world.

44
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:47,940
I didn't mean it like that.

45
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:49,940
That's how grandma understood it!

46
00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:51,940
You started that topic.

47
00:02:51,940 --> 00:02:55,940
Well, no one takes my words seriously.

48
00:02:55,940 --> 00:02:57,940
Oh, oh, what did I do?

49
00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:02,940
Not here either.

50
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:10,940
Where have I put it?

51
00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:18,940
Here.

52
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:25,940
Ui.

53
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:41,940
I know I've seen it here.

54
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:43,940
Seen something just ask?

55
00:03:43,940 --> 00:03:44,940
You can never tell.

56
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:47,940
You can find just about anything in IsoÃ¤ini's recipe book.

57
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:49,940
What could it be?

58
00:03:49,940 --> 00:03:54,940
Isn't mom looking for instructions for some particularly delicious food,

59
00:03:54,940 --> 00:03:57,940
which he has never offered us.

60
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:00,940
Here it is.

61
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:04,940
What to do when the family is tired of your food?

62
00:04:04,940 --> 00:04:06,940
Good.

63
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:10,940
Good.

64
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:40,940
Oh.

65
00:04:42,940 --> 00:04:44,940
Tumor.

66
00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:46,940
The soup boiled over.

67
00:04:46,940 --> 00:04:48,940
Oh yeah.

68
00:04:49,940 --> 00:04:51,940
Good morning, I'm snotty.

69
00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:53,940
Good morning Moomin mom.

70
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:56,940
Shows Prepare van snacks.

71
00:04:56,940 --> 00:04:58,940
Anyone going on a trip?

72
00:04:58,940 --> 00:05:00,940
Well, I'm leaving.

73
00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:02,940
Oh, you?

74
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:10,940
Oh.

75
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:17,940
Dear Moominpappa sells Moomin trolls.

76
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:20,940
I'm going in search of a rare substance,

77
00:05:20,940 --> 00:05:23,940
which is needed even for special food.

78
00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:25,940
Oh.

79
00:05:25,940 --> 00:05:27,940
Hm?

80
00:05:27,940 --> 00:05:31,940
I have to leave you for four or five days,

81
00:05:31,940 --> 00:05:36,940
but I have prepared for you dishes that you can easily eat.

82
00:05:36,940 --> 00:05:38,940
The mornings are still cool.

83
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:41,940
Remember to keep your neck and feet warm.

84
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:45,940
There is another jar of pumpkin jam on the top shelf.

85
00:05:48,940 --> 00:05:51,940
Oh, snort, little one.

86
00:05:55,940 --> 00:05:57,940
Don't go looking for me.

87
00:05:57,940 --> 00:05:59,940
Please take care of me.

88
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:03,940
See you soon, best regards mule mamma.

89
00:06:07,940 --> 00:06:09,940
Hm.

90
00:06:21,940 --> 00:06:23,940
Yes.

91
00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:34,940
Snuff changes.

92
00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:37,940
I'm snuffling.

93
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:40,940
Moomin mamma, let me help carry.

94
00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:43,940
No thanks, I have to survive on my own.

95
00:06:43,940 --> 00:06:45,940
My family is not allowed to follow me.

96
00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:47,940
I live in Teuta.

97
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:50,940
And I don't really belong to the Moomin family.

98
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:53,940
Oh yeah, you don't.

99
00:06:53,940 --> 00:06:56,940
Well, where are we going?

100
00:06:56,940 --> 00:06:59,940
South of the Lonely Mountains.

101
00:06:59,940 --> 00:07:02,940
Yeah, over there.

102
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:06,940
There is a secret valley that no one knows about.

103
00:07:06,940 --> 00:07:10,940
Clear. Let's go hiking.

104
00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:12,940
Hm.

105
00:07:21,940 --> 00:07:24,940
So we went.

106
00:07:25,940 --> 00:07:27,940
Did you hear about Moomin mom?

107
00:07:27,940 --> 00:07:30,940
I heard. Let's hurry.

108
00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:34,940
Au.

109
00:07:36,940 --> 00:07:38,940
Where is Moomin-Pekko?

110
00:07:38,940 --> 00:07:40,940
In the kitchen.

111
00:07:43,940 --> 00:07:45,940
Moomin-Pekko!

112
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:56,940
Everything happens so quickly.

113
00:07:56,940 --> 00:07:59,940
I was gone for a measly five minutes.

114
00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:01,940
What happened?

115
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:03,940
Moomin papa tries his cooking skills.

116
00:08:03,940 --> 00:08:06,940
The purpose was to bake pancakes.

117
00:08:06,940 --> 00:08:08,940
Really nice pancakes.

118
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:10,940
Could you have done better yourself?

119
00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:13,940
One pleasure, why are you mourning for nothing?

120
00:08:13,940 --> 00:08:17,940
In the cupboard there is bread, juice and syrup and raisins in whatever measure you like.

121
00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:20,940
How's the soup doing?

122
00:08:20,940 --> 00:08:25,940
Well, then you won't eat soup or pancakes for lunch.

123
00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:27,940
What if Mummy Moomin doesn't come back?

124
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:29,940
Why not come back?

125
00:08:29,940 --> 00:08:33,940
Mom said she was leaving for four or five days.

126
00:08:33,940 --> 00:08:35,940
For five days?

127
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:38,940
We will have to starve for almost a week.

128
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:43,940
Moomin papa, we need to find mommy and bring her home.

129
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:46,940
Oh no, we can't do that.

130
00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:53,940
Mamma went on a trip because she needs to get ingredients for the recipe in grandma's recipe book.

131
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:55,940
Mom knows what she's doing.

132
00:08:55,940 --> 00:08:59,940
Don't worry, today I will cook for you.

133
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:01,940
do you cook

134
00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:02,940
Are you sure you can?

135
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:05,940
Well, I cook food for my brother every day.

136
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:09,940
Great, together we can get through somehow.

137
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:27,940
Ah, good smell.

138
00:09:27,940 --> 00:09:32,940
I found wild apples and mushrooms and you apparently caught fish.

139
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:34,940
Are they fried or steamed?

140
00:09:34,940 --> 00:09:37,940
How only when you cook.

141
00:09:39,940 --> 00:09:43,940
No one in Moominvalley eats as well as I do tonight.

142
00:09:55,940 --> 00:09:58,940
Oh, you're on your way.

143
00:09:58,940 --> 00:10:01,940
My sister Parka has seen far too little of me.

144
00:10:01,940 --> 00:10:06,940
Besides, maybe you want to face the ordeal in peace.

145
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:13,940
Well, I don't necessarily want to intrude either.

146
00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:19,940
Don't cry baby girl, we know you tried your best.

147
00:10:19,940 --> 00:10:21,940
Well, that's the worst part.

148
00:10:21,940 --> 00:10:25,940
The color of the soup is just strange and the smell unusual.

149
00:10:25,940 --> 00:10:26,940
Or what?

150
00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:30,940
Right, but the taste is definitely excellent.

151
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:35,940
I saw that it is not mentioned slyly.

152
00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:36,940
Father?

153
00:10:36,940 --> 00:10:39,940
It's a bit salty, maybe.

154
00:10:39,940 --> 00:10:44,940
Let's add water and it will be good and last longer.

155
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:47,940
Not at all now.

156
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:52,940
Oh mamma, come back soon.

157
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:07,940
The stars twinkled beautifully, I haven't been on a hike in a long time.

158
00:11:09,940 --> 00:11:14,940
It's like I'm a little boy scout again, this is really fun.

159
00:11:15,940 --> 00:11:18,940
I thought you'd miss the Moomin house.

160
00:11:18,940 --> 00:11:24,940
No, no, once in a while you have to sleep under the starry sky.

161
00:11:25,940 --> 00:11:27,940
Beautiful.

162
00:11:32,940 --> 00:11:34,940
Moomin wakes up.

163
00:11:36,940 --> 00:11:37,940
Father.

164
00:11:37,940 --> 00:11:40,940
My son, the day has begun.

165
00:11:40,940 --> 00:11:44,940
We follow the mother's usual command come what comes.

166
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:46,940
What does that mean?

167
00:12:08,940 --> 00:12:11,940
Listen, would there be enough food for me too?

168
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:16,940
Of course, and my sister can make decent fins.

169
00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:22,940
Good morning, Moomin and Moompapa.

170
00:12:22,940 --> 00:12:23,940
Morning, morning.

171
00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:24,940
Lots of laundry.

172
00:12:24,940 --> 00:12:26,940
Did you wash everything together?

173
00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:29,940
Yeah, my paws are all wrinkled from the water.

174
00:12:29,940 --> 00:12:33,940
Go in and dry yourself off, you're catching a cold.

175
00:12:33,940 --> 00:12:37,940
First you have to wipe the whole house dry.

176
00:12:38,940 --> 00:12:39,940
What now?

177
00:12:39,940 --> 00:12:44,940
Nothing, has mom always done all this alone?

178
00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:48,940
Yes, and we still have to clean and wash the windows.

179
00:12:48,940 --> 00:12:50,940
Cooking and sewing.

180
00:12:51,940 --> 00:12:52,940
Father!

181
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:58,940
Got it clear, I didn't realize there was so much homework.

182
00:12:58,940 --> 00:13:02,940
Would we eat canned food from cardboard plates?

183
00:13:03,940 --> 00:13:05,940
The road ends here.

184
00:13:07,940 --> 00:13:11,940
We have turned somewhere in the wrong direction.

185
00:13:12,940 --> 00:13:15,940
The book does say that the road goes here.

186
00:13:15,940 --> 00:13:17,940
Would you cut some reeds for me?

187
00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:18,940
Yes?

188
00:13:29,940 --> 00:13:32,940
What exactly are you going to do with the reeds?

189
00:13:33,940 --> 00:13:35,940
I'll wait and you'll see.

190
00:13:37,940 --> 00:13:41,940
What are you going to put in those giant pots?

191
00:13:41,940 --> 00:13:44,940
What do you think? Us, of course.

192
00:13:45,940 --> 00:13:47,940
Oh, of course.

193
00:13:49,940 --> 00:13:50,940
Are you serious?

194
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:55,940
That's right, grandma said it has to be done this way.

195
00:13:55,940 --> 00:13:57,940
Or would you rather stay here?

196
00:13:57,940 --> 00:14:02,940
Well no, I can't let you go alone.

197
00:14:04,940 --> 00:14:09,940
Come on, let's get on the boats. Y, ka, ko.

198
00:14:21,940 --> 00:14:23,940
Isn't that awesome?

199
00:14:23,940 --> 00:14:26,940
You won't get into trouble if you follow grandma's instructions.

200
00:14:26,940 --> 00:14:29,940
Well, what should we do next?

201
00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:32,940
Hmm, now almost nothing.

202
00:14:35,940 --> 00:14:37,940
What is that sound?

203
00:14:37,940 --> 00:14:39,940
Can't you hear?

204
00:14:42,940 --> 00:14:44,940
I guess not.

205
00:14:49,940 --> 00:14:52,940
Hold on tight Mummy Moomin.

206
00:14:52,940 --> 00:14:53,940
So do you.

207
00:14:53,940 --> 00:14:55,940
Guide me here with my hands.

208
00:15:00,940 --> 00:15:02,940
Oh, sorry.

209
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:28,940
Moomin mom, hey wake up.

210
00:15:28,940 --> 00:15:31,940
Wow, I slept so sweetly.

211
00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:41,940
So this is the secret valley you are looking for.

212
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:44,940
At least it should be.

213
00:15:48,940 --> 00:15:51,940
Oh, delicious looking cherries.

214
00:15:51,940 --> 00:15:53,940
What makes a good pie?

215
00:15:53,940 --> 00:15:55,940
Or what do you think?

216
00:15:55,940 --> 00:15:59,940
Probably, but those are ordinary cherries.

217
00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:02,940
Weren't you looking for rare ingredients?

218
00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:07,940
True, but it doesn't matter what you collect as long as you collect from this valley.

219
00:16:07,940 --> 00:16:10,940
Now let's get home.

220
00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:13,940
Or does it not matter what is collected?

221
00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:19,940
Snuffbox.

222
00:16:19,940 --> 00:16:21,940
Oh, sorry.

223
00:16:21,940 --> 00:16:23,940
Isn't this enough already?

224
00:16:23,940 --> 00:16:25,940
But how?

225
00:16:25,940 --> 00:16:27,940
We get back upstream.

226
00:16:27,940 --> 00:16:29,940
There is no climbing over the mountain.

227
00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:31,940
Oh yeah, that's true.

228
00:16:31,940 --> 00:16:33,940
Skinned.

229
00:16:33,940 --> 00:16:35,940
I'll have to look in the book.

230
00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:37,940
Aha, here.

231
00:16:37,940 --> 00:16:39,940
Moominvalley is full.

232
00:16:39,940 --> 00:16:41,940
Moominvalley is full.

233
00:16:41,940 --> 00:16:43,940
Moominvalley is full.

234
00:16:43,940 --> 00:16:45,940
Moominvalley is full.

235
00:16:45,940 --> 00:16:47,940
Moominvalley is full.

236
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:49,940
Moominvalley is full.

237
00:16:49,940 --> 00:16:51,940
Moominvalley is full.

238
00:16:51,940 --> 00:16:53,940
Moominvalley is full.

239
00:16:54,940 --> 00:16:58,940
Moominvalley is steerwaterkaSO nÃ¤sÃ¤.

240
00:16:58,940 --> 00:17:03,940
Muumilaakso on steerwaterkaSO achieve numeral officially filled.

241
00:17:03,940 --> 00:17:06,940
In Moomin dialect, boil oncia is used.

242
00:17:06,940 --> 00:17:11,940
Moomin varmentation target for 1 minute.

243
00:17:11,940 --> 00:17:16,940
Muumilaaksi var linguistic key taimel-Ø¯ bored system alas.

244
00:17:16,940 --> 00:17:18,940
Oh, we came here?

245
00:17:18,940 --> 00:17:20,940
To the open sea.

246
00:17:20,940 --> 00:17:22,940
A bit confusing.

247
00:17:24,940 --> 00:17:26,940
Ah, hey mom!

248
00:17:27,940 --> 00:17:31,940
The bathroom, we're actually at home already.

249
00:17:31,940 --> 00:17:33,940
I don't understand.

250
00:17:33,940 --> 00:17:36,940
If we were this close to the secret valley all the time,

251
00:17:36,940 --> 00:17:38,940
why didn't we use forward?

252
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:40,940
I don't understand.

253
00:17:40,940 --> 00:17:42,940
I don't understand.

254
00:17:42,940 --> 00:17:45,940
If we were this close to the secret valley all the time,

255
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:47,940
why didn't we use this road?

256
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:50,940
I think it will take many days to reach the valley.

257
00:17:50,940 --> 00:17:54,940
Otherwise, the secret power of cherries will not work.

258
00:17:54,940 --> 00:17:55,940
No power?

259
00:17:55,940 --> 00:17:56,940
So.

260
00:17:56,940 --> 00:17:58,940
Well, let's paddle now.

261
00:17:58,940 --> 00:18:01,940
I already miss Moomin Valley.

262
00:18:10,940 --> 00:18:12,940
No?

263
00:18:13,940 --> 00:18:15,940
Almost a real pancake.

264
00:18:15,940 --> 00:18:17,940
I'm making progress.

265
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:21,940
I'm already getting tired of just jam and pickles.

266
00:18:24,940 --> 00:18:26,940
Sell, don't be lazy.

267
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:28,940
You have many squares left.

268
00:18:28,940 --> 00:18:30,940
Yes, I know that.

269
00:18:30,940 --> 00:18:34,940
I have never washed my own windows.

270
00:18:34,940 --> 00:18:36,940
Shut your mouth and swing the wheel!

271
00:18:36,940 --> 00:18:40,940
Too clean window panes are dangerous for birds.

272
00:18:40,940 --> 00:18:43,940
Mom has been gone for four days now.

273
00:18:43,940 --> 00:18:47,940
He said he would stay no more than five days.

274
00:18:48,940 --> 00:18:51,940
Father, Miss Niisku, come quickly.

275
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:54,940
What is it?

276
00:18:54,940 --> 00:18:56,940
Look.

277
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:02,940
Mom listens.

278
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:04,940
Mother!

279
00:19:04,940 --> 00:19:06,940
Movie momma, movie momma!

280
00:19:06,940 --> 00:19:08,940
Mother!

281
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:10,940
Mother!

282
00:19:10,940 --> 00:19:12,940
Let me help.

283
00:19:12,940 --> 00:19:13,940
I'll take the backpack.

284
00:19:13,940 --> 00:19:15,940
Not me!

285
00:19:15,940 --> 00:19:17,940
Thank you, thank you.

286
00:19:20,940 --> 00:19:24,940
That was the end of Mamma Moomin's private trip.

287
00:19:24,940 --> 00:19:28,940
She baked a huge cherry pie.

288
00:19:28,940 --> 00:19:32,940
And fried and cooked one thing and another.

289
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:34,940
The Namias!

290
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:36,940
Fairytale cherries!

291
00:19:36,940 --> 00:19:40,940
Yes, it was worth going so far to get them.

292
00:19:40,940 --> 00:19:43,940
Moomin papa can bake pancakes.

293
00:19:43,940 --> 00:19:45,940
Really?

294
00:19:45,940 --> 00:19:50,940
Well, of course I'm not nearly as good as you.

295
00:19:52,940 --> 00:19:54,940
Stop it!

296
00:19:54,940 --> 00:19:56,940
There is enough food.

297
00:19:56,940 --> 00:19:58,940
Mother!

298
00:19:58,940 --> 00:20:00,940
Mother!

299
00:20:00,940 --> 00:20:03,940
Stop it! There is enough food.

300
00:20:03,940 --> 00:20:06,940
I want the last pancake.

301
00:20:06,940 --> 00:20:09,940
You were so tired of pancakes.

302
00:20:09,940 --> 00:20:11,940
Or was it?

303
00:20:13,940 --> 00:20:15,940
Yes, but I'm not anymore.

304
00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:20,940
Moomin mamma's trip was worth it.

305
00:20:20,940 --> 00:20:23,940
The little one liked pancakes again.

306
00:20:23,940 --> 00:20:27,940
And Moomin Pappa had almost learned how to fry them.

307
00:20:30,940 --> 00:20:32,940
Thanks.
