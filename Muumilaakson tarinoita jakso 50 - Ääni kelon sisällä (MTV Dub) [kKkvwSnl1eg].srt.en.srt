00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Hemuli is walking again in Moomin Valley looking for rare plants for his collection.

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Lord time.

3
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
ha I Su Li!

4
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Huh? I'm searching.

5
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Stink, why are you always up to mischief?

6
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Eh, I just know.

7
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
What if someone kicked you?

8
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Yes, but when you see someone bending over like that, at least I can't avoid the temptation to kick the little one. Can you do it yourself?

9
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,000
It's like a little devil lives inside you.

10
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Oh what? Well, that's how it is! It's that nasty little devil who tells me to do all the defiance that I would otherwise do in the world.

11
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Then tell it to come out.

12
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Oh, just about that? How can that really work out?

13
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Let's think.

14
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Does the snob know how to do it?

15
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Do you want to evict it?

16
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Of course.

17
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Then it's pretty easy.

18
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Tell me in wonder.

19
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
There is nothing evil about you.

20
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Right?

21
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:54,000
It's just your imagination. You have to make up your mind very firmly not to do any naughty things.

22
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Must decide not to do naughty things.

23
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Haisuli won't change for any reason.

24
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Do you think so?

25
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
What do you think?

26
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
No.

27
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
There's no point in even trying.

28
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
There isn't.

29
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Yes.

30
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Good text.

31
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Now I would like a cup of coffee made by my mother.

32
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
In.

33
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Does a cup of coffee taste good?

34
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Joo.

35
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Perfect timing.

36
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Yes.

37
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:41,000
I just thought to myself that I would like a cup of coffee now.

38
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
And then you came.

39
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
The writing seems to flow well.

40
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Here is a new version of an old story about a devil living inside a tree.

41
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
You know.

42
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Shall I have another cup?

43
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
What?

44
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Oh, oh.

45
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Oh.

46
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,000
I won't give up.

47
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Hi Muli, what hatana?

48
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,480
I need to get that plant in my collection but I can't get up enough.

49
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:36,920
I can climb up and get it for you.

50
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,600
You are kind. With pleasure.

51
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:41,680
Thanks.

52
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:46,080
Youth is wonderful. You should become a botanist too.

53
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:48,680
Uh...

54
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:52,160
Digging plant from the ground with roots and leaves.

55
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:55,600
Be careful, Moomin-Pekko.

56
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:57,920
I'm almost there.

57
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:00,640
Uh...

58
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:02,720
Uh...

59
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:04,800
Uh...

60
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:06,400
Uh...

61
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:08,480
ha I Su Li!

62
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:10,560
Uh!

63
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:12,640
Hehehe...

64
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:14,720
Are you OK?

65
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:18,560
It's a pretty flower, it's a shame I don't have a buttonhole.

66
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:22,640
It is Hemul's flower and you know it. Give it back right away.

67
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:28,240
I was here first. Will I become a botanist too?

68
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:30,320
That's enough now.

69
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:32,400
Uh...

70
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:34,480
Hehehe...

71
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:36,560
Plant park.

72
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:39,600
I'll help you find a similar one. Don't worry.

73
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:42,160
It seems that the devil really lives in Haisuli.

74
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:46,240
I think better that Haisuli is just being himself.

75
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:48,320
That's all.

76
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:50,400
Hehehe...

77
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:55,200
Hehehe...

78
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:04,400
Have you ever seen a yellow flower this size...

79
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:06,480
...with a red middle part.

80
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:08,560
I guess you can't tell.

81
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:10,640
Because you don't talk.

82
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:20,800
Strange beings.

83
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:26,800
Capp. Hemuli, I found it nobody.

84
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,800
Did the Hattivats leave?

85
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:34,800
They left. Here is the rare plant you are looking for.

86
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,800
Let me see.

87
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:41,800
Oh, that's it.

88
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:44,800
Did you find it?

89
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:45,800
Yes.

90
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:46,800
Great.

91
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:50,800
How can I ever thank you enough, you are a good friend.

92
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:51,800
What about that?

93
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:54,800
Thanks to you too, Moomin goblin.

94
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:00,800
He was impossibly evil, even devilish.

95
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:10,800
But when he was caught, he began his shrill complaint, promising to be impossibly kind from now on, to help everyone and do favors.

96
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:15,800
But the captives didn't believe a word because they knew how to read the devil's thoughts.

97
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:19,800
It was locked in a small cave where it could do no more harm.

98
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:24,800
And even though it tried everything it could, it couldn't escape.

99
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:30,800
The name of the cave is still today Pirun Kolo, but no one knows where it got its name from.

100
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,800
It was a strange thing.

101
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:33,800
And what?

102
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:37,800
You just said that no one knows where that name comes from.

103
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:42,800
I meant that in my story no one knows where the name comes from.

104
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:44,800
Where is Pirun Kolo?

105
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:48,800
Well, there, in the distant forest where the story takes place.

106
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,800
How far is that forest?

107
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,800
I don't know.

108
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,800
You wrote that story.

109
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,800
It's just a story.

110
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,800
Is the whole story still a fairy tale?

111
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:03,800
This is a story that has been told from generation to generation and no one knows if it is true or not.

112
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:10,800
I still find it strange. If you know why it's Pirun Kolo, then others should know about it too.

113
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:14,800
All right. I'll rewrite it.

114
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:19,800
Niisku-neiti, would you like to hide?

115
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:21,800
Let's just be.

116
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:26,800
Why on earth are you cooking in here even though the sun is shining?

117
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:30,800
Muunipappa has written a new story and he read it to us.

118
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:31,800
Really?

119
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:36,800
It had a few weak points, but luckily we happened to be there to tell what was going on.

120
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:38,800
Did it really go that way?

121
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,800
Unfortunately, that's how it went.

122
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:45,800
I wouldn't have guessed that you are literary critics.

123
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:48,800
I can't help pointing out that we are excellent at that.

124
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,800
Well, just excuse me.

125
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:59,800
What if today we play a different game of hide and seek, if two of us hide together and everyone else searches?

126
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:04,800
As long as I don't end up hiding with Nipsu, he's as good at hiding as Ostrich.

127
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:07,800
We will share the pairs only when we get there.

128
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:08,800
How are the pairs distributed?

129
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:11,800
We can do a lottery. That would be fair.

130
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:13,800
I want to be your partner.

131
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:15,800
So do I.

132
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:22,800
Wrong lottery, did you hear? I want one of you to be my partner. In the game of hide and seek, you should be small. We wouldn't be found on Takuu.

133
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:26,800
I guess you told your mother that you went to play with us?

134
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:28,800
Did you tell mom?

135
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,800
I don't. Did you tell?

136
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:35,800
I didn't tell. I thought you told me because you're older.

137
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:38,800
Then no one told Vili who.

138
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:41,800
It won't be long enough for him to worry.

139
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:45,800
But you can't jump in the game of hide and seek either.

140
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:51,800
A pinch!

141
00:08:57,800 --> 00:09:00,800
Nipsu and Niskunneiti found.

142
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:03,800
This is how Nipsu is the tail.

143
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:05,800
I told you to hide it.

144
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:07,800
I thought it was hidden.

145
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:10,800
Now we're going to hide with the little one.

146
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:14,800
Turn away and slowly count to twenty.

147
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:21,800
One, two, three, four, five, six.

148
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:24,800
I know a good hiding spot. Come after.

149
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:31,800
Eight, nine, ten.

150
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:35,800
Hey, look!

151
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:41,800
That must be a good hiding place.

152
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:43,800
We can't be found there.

153
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:44,800
Can't even be found.

154
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:47,800
It's harder for me to find a hiding place than you.

155
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:49,800
You can't fit in there, can you?

156
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:50,800
I am.

157
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:51,800
I am.

158
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:52,800
I am.

159
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:53,800
I am.

160
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:54,800
I am.

161
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:55,800
I am.

162
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:56,800
I am.

163
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:57,800
I am.

164
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:58,800
I am.

165
00:09:58,800 --> 00:09:59,800
I am.

166
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:00,800
I am.

167
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:01,800
I am.

168
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:02,800
I am.

169
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:03,800
I am.

170
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:04,800
I am.

171
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:05,800
I am.

172
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:06,800
I am.

173
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:07,800
I am.

174
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:08,800
I am.

175
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:09,800
I am.

176
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:10,800
I am.

177
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:11,800
I am.

178
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:12,800
I am.

179
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:13,800
I am.

180
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:14,800
I am.

181
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:15,800
I am.

182
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:16,800
I am.

183
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:17,800
I am.

184
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:18,800
I am.

185
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:19,800
I am.

186
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:20,800
I am.

187
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:21,800
I am.

188
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:22,800
I am.

189
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:23,800
I am.

190
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:24,800
I am.

191
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:25,800
I am.

192
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:26,800
I am.

193
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:27,800
I am.

194
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:28,800
I am.

195
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:29,800
I am.

196
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:30,800
I am.

197
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:31,800
I am.

198
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:33,800
Tasteless Peikko! Tasteless Peikko!

199
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:35,800
We have been seen.

200
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:37,800
Long night!

201
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:39,800
Can they see me too?

202
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:41,800
But you checked it out.

203
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:43,800
I think you were making too much noise.

204
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:51,800
There's no one here.

205
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:53,800
I'm not sure.

206
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:55,800
Here I am.

207
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:57,800
who are you

208
00:10:57,800 --> 00:10:59,800
And where would you hide?

209
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:01,800
I'm right in front of you.

210
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:05,800
In front of us is only a dead tree.

211
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:09,800
Right. And I am inside that Kelo.

212
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:13,800
Then you must be even smaller than me.

213
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:15,800
I used to be very big.

214
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:19,800
But then I was kind of melted here.

215
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:21,800
Just like that.

216
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:23,800
Yes, Moomin.

217
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:27,800
Oh, Moomin.

218
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:29,800
Did you ask him?

219
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:31,800
Look.

220
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:35,800
They don't even try to hide.

221
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:39,800
Or they got tired of waiting for us and came out of hiding.

222
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:43,800
Why are they staring at that tree so strangely?

223
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:45,800
Now I know.

224
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:47,800
What do you really know now?

225
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:51,800
An Evil Devil lives inside the tree.

226
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:53,800
Evil devil?

227
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:57,800
Confess, you are the Evil Devil.

228
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:05,800
It was wisely reasoned.

229
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:09,800
I didn't think you'd recognize me, but it's true.

230
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:11,800
I'm the devil.

231
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:13,800
What?

232
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:15,800
Right again.

233
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:17,800
Johan is incredible.

234
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:19,800
Are you talking to that tree?

235
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:23,800
We are not talking to that tree, but to the devil inside the tree.

236
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:25,800
To the devil?

237
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:29,800
Inside the tree? In Moominpapa's story it was in a small cave.

238
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:33,800
It wouldn't be the first time Moominpappa makes a mistake.

239
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:37,800
Even familiar stories change over hundreds of years.

240
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:43,800
You're smart too. You are smarter than you look.

241
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:50,800
If there's a real devil inside the tree, we should get out of here.

242
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:52,800
It should.

243
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:56,800
Wait, I've been inside a tree for 500 years.

244
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:58,800
I want out.

245
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:01,800
Sure, but you're an Evil Devil too.

246
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:03,800
I'm not mean anymore.

247
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:08,800
I can forgive all my mischief and now I have become a kind devil.

248
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:10,800
All right, believe me.

249
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:12,800
Hardly.

250
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:14,800
It certainly isn't.

251
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:19,800
If you could only see me, you would understand that you have nothing to worry about.

252
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:23,800
But you can never see me while I'm a prisoner here.

253
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:25,800
We don't care.

254
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:28,800
It's hard to be kind inside a tree.

255
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:31,800
What do we get out of it if we let you out?

256
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:33,800
Stop the rant.

257
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:38,800
You get whatever you want. I have great magical powers when you only wish.

258
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:41,800
We're not sure if we'll let you out.

259
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:45,800
He got it out. You can hear from his voice that he is kind.

260
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:48,800
Could I have a big sack of gold coins?

261
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:51,800
The second I get out.

262
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:53,800
Thanks.

263
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:55,800
We would also like to.

264
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:57,800
Please tell me.

265
00:13:57,800 --> 00:14:01,800
We don't want mom to get mad at us if we're late for dinner.

266
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:04,800
It's fine. He won't even notice you're not home.

267
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:05,800
Wait a minute.

268
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:08,800
You don't want to let him out either, do you?

269
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:10,800
He is a kind devil these days.

270
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:14,800
I would really like a real pearl necklace.

271
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:16,800
You get it.

272
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:19,800
I want a new and twice as fast skateboard.

273
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:22,800
We don't know if the devil has changed.

274
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:25,800
It better not play tricks on me.

275
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:29,800
All that's left is the Moomin. What would you like?

276
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:32,800
All I want is for you to tell us the truth.

277
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:36,800
It'll be over soon. And you don't want anything else?

278
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:39,800
I don't. I have no other wishes. Just thank you.

279
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:42,800
You are stubborn.

280
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:45,800
Sorry I got nervous.

281
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:49,800
I am in such an impossible hurry to do good deeds for you.

282
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:53,800
How can we free you from inside the tree?

283
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:58,800
You have to push the reed in from the crack that is right in front of you.

284
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:00,800
That's how I get out.

285
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:02,800
But there are no reeds here.

286
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:04,800
Well, go find it then.

287
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:07,800
Or could it be found somewhere in a meadow?

288
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:09,800
Oh yeah, of course. Warm up.

289
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:11,800
A pinch, hey.

290
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:16,800
Hurry up. I can't wait to give you your gift.

291
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:26,800
Stink, what are you looking at?

292
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:28,800
Nus cam Ichinomiya year.

293
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:32,800
Sorry I took it. I wanted to return it to Hemull.

294
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:36,800
We already found another one. What exactly are they doing there?

295
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:40,800
Something strange is happening there. They're talking to that reel.

296
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:44,800
Hello! I found those reeds.

297
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:48,800
What the hell is Nipsu doing with the food?

298
00:15:57,800 --> 00:15:59,800
That's it now.

299
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:04,800
Come on devil, get out of there.

300
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:08,800
Hm?

301
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:12,800
Urja-looking clouds.

302
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:14,800
Oh, oh, oh!

303
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:16,800
Oh, oh, oh!

304
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:18,800
Oh, oh, oh!

305
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:22,800
Oh, oh, oh!

306
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:24,800
Oh, oh, oh!

307
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:43,800
Five hundred years! Five hundred long years in prison!

308
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:46,800
Now I'm going to have fun!

309
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:50,800
He lied after all.

310
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:55,640
Of course. There is no such thing as a good or honest devil.

311
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:58,240
As long as I get those gold coins, then...

312
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:01,840
Did you imagine I would keep my promise?

313
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:03,560
Uh...

314
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:07,840
What were you thinking of doing? You are guaranteed to rust after 500 years.

315
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:11,560
First, I'm going to make devils out of you all.

316
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:13,640
And you don't. I'm running the paddock.

317
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:15,720
Aaaah!

318
00:17:20,360 --> 00:17:21,840
I can't move.

319
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:24,360
Did you think you got away?

320
00:17:25,840 --> 00:17:27,720
A real little devil.

321
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:29,720
It was inside that Kelo.

322
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:33,240
Ugh... It was really stupid to let it out of there.

323
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:39,040
Something has to be done about it. I'll go and put an end to this.

324
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:42,080
Nuskamukkonen wait!

325
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:44,240
Get ready, Moomin!

326
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:46,160
What do you mean?

327
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:48,600
You get to choose because you are the first.

328
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:52,280
Will you become a devil, a frog or a snake?

329
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:56,360
Ugh...

330
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:04,240
Who dares approach me?

331
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:06,480
Nuskamuikkunen, Moomin's friend.

332
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:09,960
Do you want to become a devil too?

333
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:11,840
I want to be like Moomin.

334
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:12,920
Ugh...

335
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:16,800
But before that, I would like to make sure of one thing.

336
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:17,880
What thing?

337
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:20,520
How do I know you're the real devil?

338
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:24,280
How dare you! So who do you think I am?

339
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:26,520
Well, you can be just a magician.

340
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:30,400
Or just a magician? How did you get such a head?

341
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:32,920
Well, when you poked around from behind that tree, then...

342
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:36,200
I came from inside the tree and not from behind it!

343
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:37,280
Hebe, hebe.

344
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:42,280
You're not kidding me. Not a large creature would be able to get through such a narrow food.

345
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:46,360
I'm the devil, and I can do whatever I want.

346
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:49,440
Just like that, but I did see you sneaking out from behind the tree.

347
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:51,800
Devils don't sneak around!

348
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:54,480
Will you believe me if I show you how it happened?

349
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:57,160
If I could see it with my own eyes, then...

350
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:02,440
I would like to see it too when I didn't see it properly before.

351
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:04,720
Well, concentrate properly then!

352
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:06,200
Jaista?

353
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:07,040
And it's not impressive...

354
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:10,240
Do you now believe in power like that?

355
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:18,120
P eviden moving again.

356
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:20,360
аемas Chad man.

357
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:21,480
Hey...

358
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:22,640
what did you do

359
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:24,560
,"Cad manRA Orthoङi."

360
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:26,420
I have

361
00:19:26,420 --> 00:19:28,420
I can move again.

362
00:19:28,420 --> 00:19:30,420
Mouska muikkunen.

363
00:19:32,420 --> 00:19:37,420
Hello. what did you do Don't touch that reed. I can't get out.

364
00:19:37,420 --> 00:19:41,420
Then you must remain there for another five hundred years.

365
00:19:41,420 --> 00:19:45,420
Was I tricked back into Kelo?

366
00:19:57,420 --> 00:20:00,420
I promised you that kickboard.

367
00:20:00,420 --> 00:20:04,420
That ball device, I know what a kickboard is. I don't believe your transparency.

368
00:20:04,420 --> 00:20:07,420
I think we're far enough away.

369
00:20:07,420 --> 00:20:09,420
True.

370
00:20:11,420 --> 00:20:14,420
Don't entangle me in the water. I can't create.

371
00:20:14,420 --> 00:20:16,420
And don't get what you want.

372
00:20:16,420 --> 00:20:20,420
Money, a skateboard and whatever else you ask for. Did you hear?

373
00:20:20,420 --> 00:20:25,420
The coil was thrown far to the ulapa and soon the streamer was gone.

374
00:20:25,420 --> 00:20:31,420
And when Moominpa came home, he wrote the whole story again.
