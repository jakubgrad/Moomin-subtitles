TSM channel

00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
...

3
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
...

4
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Ui...

5
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
...

6
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:05,000
The sick girl that Nipsu had found and taken to the Moomin House slept late the next morning.

7
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Good morning!

8
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Good morning, Moomin.

9
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
How is the girl?

10
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
The fever is on its way.

11
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Oh, he's still sleeping.

12
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Grandma's medicine took away the fever, but she is very tired. Rest is good for him.

13
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
What about the patient?

14
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Better already. The color has returned to the cheeks and the fever has subsided. He'll recover from it soon.

15
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Mmm...

16
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:56,000
These flowers, I have plucked the twigs for you, oh lovely maiden.

17
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Hey, it's so exciting to be excited.

18
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Good morning, Papa Moomin.

19
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Morning, you're up early.

20
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Is Moomin still sleeping?

21
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Joo.

22
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Not that I'm interested, but how is the girl?

23
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Better, but he needs another year of rest. Don't worry.

24
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Would I worry?

25
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Fireworks rockets.

26
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Yes, and handsome. Rumblings were heard many nights, but the cause of them was only discovered on the beach.

27
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Myi noticed a wonderful light phenomenon from behind these trees.

28
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Or with the roar of the firework rockets, it almost woke me up too.

29
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
They were loud.

30
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Or with the roar of the firework rockets, it almost woke me up too.

31
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,000
They were handsome looking, but terribly noisy.

32
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:14,000
It was remarkable that no one saw fireworks from here in Moomin Valley.

33
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
They were shot into the sky from too far away.

34
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Tongo, the beach is close and you have to watch the fireworks from a distance.

35
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Sell, why weren't they visible here?

36
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Idiot, that's what I'm wondering when I don't know.

37
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Well, who's messing with us?

38
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Does it hurt?

39
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Yes, and could have supervised me.

40
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
It wobbles in a different cunning way.

41
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
I'm going with you tonight.

42
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Ai, minne?

43
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Well, to the beach to catch the wind.

44
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
That's what you're going to do.

45
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:57,000
And that, I haven't talked to Nuuska Muikkunen yet.

46
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
I'm talking to me.

47
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Listen Nipsu, if someone wants to shoot firework rockets at night stealthily,

48
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,000
that someone wants to remain invisible for sure.

49
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Well, it's obvious.

50
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:15,000
If he doesn't want to show himself, maybe we should leave him alone.

51
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Petya, at least I'm leaving.

52
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Alone on the beach in the middle of the night?

53
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Not me alone. There will also be a retail sale.

54
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
It's the same for me.

55
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
If you don't dare, go alone.

56
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Eh, that's not what I meant.

57
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
I guess you also want to know who is there?

58
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Sorry to bother you, but would someone go and change the wet towel on the girl's forehead?

59
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
I have my hands full with work.

60
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Er, I'm going!

61
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
are you going

62
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
What's wrong with you?

63
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:49,000
I saved the girl's life, maybe you can't trust anyone.

64
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Oh!

65
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Remember not to wring the towel too much in the water.

66
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Yeah. What the hell has happened?

67
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
He's completely messed up.

68
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Hi, and haa.

69
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Oh.

70
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
About.

71
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Oh.

72
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Sleeping Beauty.

73
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Oh.

74
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Oh!

75
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Oh!

76
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,000
No, you just stay in bed.

77
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,000
who are you

78
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Don't you remember me?

79
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,000
I'm a jerk.

80
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:16,000
I saved lives, I brought you here.

81
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Oh, right?

82
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:24,000
You don't remember me, even though I'm strutting around in a sweat hat.

83
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Oh, I apologize.

84
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:31,000
You told me that you had come to see the hemul and then went to work.

85
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Hemulia?

86
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Woe to you, Don't you even remember the hemuli?

87
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,000
I don't. Oh, stop stoned.

88
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Fear not, it may not be fatal. I'm calling mommy Moomin.

89
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Is it your mother?

90
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Not like Moomin. This is a Moomin house.

91
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Moomin house. Moomin.

92
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Tytte has already woken up.

93
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Well, did he say something?

94
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Nothing to mention. He doesn't remember me.

95
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Really?

96
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:15,000
How is that possible? I held him above me and he looked at me.

97
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Is it hard to remember my face?

98
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
I find them harder to forget.

99
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Did you ask his name?

100
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
I forgot.

101
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Is there anything new about the girl?

102
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
He has woken up.

103
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
It's fun.

104
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Let's go take a look.

105
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Just stay in your fields.

106
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,000
No stone unturned. I already feel good.

107
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Oh great.

108
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Is your aunt a Moomin?

109
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
I am. What do you already know?

110
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:02,000
That boy tells and I think aunty looks just like Moomin.

111
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Oh shit. She has picked those flowers for you.

112
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Oh dear.

113
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Tell me what your name is.

114
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
My name is Nana.

115
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Would you like the food?

116
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
You have slept for a long time.

117
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
I'm a little hungry.

118
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
I guessed. I'll bring you some soup.

119
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Thanks.

120
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
And greetings to that nice boy.

121
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Sorry if I was rude to him.

122
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Nipsu thinks you've lost your memory.

123
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Yours.

124
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Everyone is curious to see you.

125
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
I invite them here.

126
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Wake up.

127
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Go further.

128
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
The girl is doing great.

129
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Oh, what fun. We were so worried.

130
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Thanks to all of you.

131
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,000
And especially for nips.

132
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Sorry I was dumber when I woke up my lifesaver.

133
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Or so?

134
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
What's the little thing?

135
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,000
So trip me up again.

136
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Dude, don't be silly.

137
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Now.

138
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
I'm Papa Moomin.

139
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:19,000
And here is our son Moomin the goblin, the little girl and the little mouse.

140
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Really fun to get to know.

141
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Hemuli also came here, but you were still sleeping.

142
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Ai Hemuli.

143
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:32,000
I have to meet him. I have an important matter.

144
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Yes, but Hemuli insists adamantly that he doesn't know you.

145
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Yes.

146
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Apparently, my fiance hasn't told Hemul about me.

147
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Groom?

148
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Well, since I'm already engaged.

149
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Engaged?

150
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:55,000
My fiance has certainly visited Moomin Valley Hemuliluo many times.

151
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Just like that.

152
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Hemuli is a good friend of mine, but she has never talked about anything about Sulhans.

153
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:08,000
But my fiancé wrote that he is currently in Moomin Valley.

154
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:12,000
What exactly is the said young man up to?

155
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Making a firework rocket launcher as my father's apprentice.

156
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Phooey!

157
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Would there be any lead varnish for you?

158
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:30,000
The children did see how someone shot fireworks at the sea yesterday.

159
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:37,000
It must have been my Fiance. I guessed he's here to make rockets.

160
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Moomin!

161
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Sniff, little one!

162
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:52,000
What exactly is going on here?

163
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:56,000
The calculation of the firework rockets has finally been solved.

164
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Well, what's the explanation?

165
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Come quickly! I'll tell you on the way.

166
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
I say where we are going.

167
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,000
For Hemul! Speed up!

168
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Just like that.

169
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Good!

170
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Glad you like it. I have cooked sopa according to my grandfather's recipe.

171
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
You are so kind to me.

172
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Will you take more?

173
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Thanks, I can't.

174
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:31,000
I'm still trying to sleep for a while. The children go in search of your Bridegroom.

175
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Thanks grandma.

176
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Why does Nanan's Husband secretly make firework rockets?

177
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,000
He wants to surprise his bride's father.

178
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:56,000
This one thinks the Groom doesn't know how to make good firework rockets.

179
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Oh, and the Groom has come to ask Hemul for help.

180
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Nana's father has fallen ill. And now there is no one to make rockets for Midsummer.

181
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
That's why Nana came to get her Fiance.

182
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Right. Nana had even tried making rockets herself.

183
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Damn, lucky he tripped over me.

184
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Aha.

185
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:39,000
My host, didn't I have to register today as well?

186
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
I guess not.

187
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Are you sure?

188
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
On.

189
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
That it wouldn't be at the bottom?

190
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Laadotonta.

191
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,000
You can tell in another letter.

192
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,000
If you didn't notice, may I look in the bag?

193
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:55,000
You watched it yesterday too, remember?

194
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
I remember.

195
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Well, how did it go? Found something?

196
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:03,000
No. It wasn't found yesterday, but maybe it will be found today.

197
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:10,000
I can't take it anymore. Penko bag, that's all! Speed, speed!

198
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Do not drop letters.

199
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Well, was there something?

200
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:23,000
I have never taken Kost to the wrong address.

201
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:27,000
I know, but I'm waiting for a terribly important letter.

202
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:30,000
From a young woman, huh?

203
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Hey Hemuli.

204
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Here is the letter.

205
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:42,000
From the Botanical Society. Seed list probably.

206
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Oh, why did you immediately say?

207
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:52,000
You doubted me yesterday. I'll pay you back now.

208
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:10,000
I was actually. Oh guys, I finally made it.

209
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
What has happened?

210
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:22,000
I have discovered a new species.

211
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Oh so?

212
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
I have discovered a new species.

213
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:29,000
And the Botanical Society has recognized it.

214
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Congratulations, let's begin.

215
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Good day.

216
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Where is the trip?

217
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
For Hemul. Is he at home?

218
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:44,000
It is, unless it has flown its way on a cloud.

219
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Oh, what fun.

220
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

221
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Oh, what fun.

222
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Hello everyone.

223
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Did you come to congratulate?

224
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
What?

225
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Well, thanks.

226
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Do you know the young man who makes firework rockets?

227
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Yeah, that, sort of.

228
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:22,000
The man's beautiful Bride has come here.

229
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Where is the man? Tell me if you know.

230
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Or the Bride? Could that girl from yesterday be his Bride?

231
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
On.

232
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:34,000
The girl finally woke up and told us everything.

233
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Oh, what a relief.

234
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:45,000
The groom prepares firework rockets in the cave for Midsummer.

235
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Is that true?

236
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Yes, but he asked me to keep it a secret for now.

237
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:54,000
We go last night to a spectacular fireworks display.

238
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Good. Then he has had time to prepare.

239
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Let's go see the man and tell him his Bride is here.

240
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Brag it. The young people will surely be happy when they see each other again.

241
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Then travel every hoof.

242
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
No wait!

243
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:21,000
Tell him that I have now been officially recognized as the discoverer of a new species of kämmekka.

244
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,000
Oh, that's great! Good luck and success!

245
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Congratulations!

246
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Thank you!

247
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:36,000
You are something to be proud of. Well, go already!

248
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Hey!

249
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Is the groom here?

250
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Let's shout!

251
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
Yay!

252
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Hey there!

253
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Hoi!

254
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
I don't think it's here.

255
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Let's investigate!

256
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
This!

257
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Are you scared?

258
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:01,000
I'm not interested in meeting anyone from the groom, nothing else.

259
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Let's go!

260
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Ahoy!

261
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Ahoy!

262
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:18,000
Nana's fiancé, I guess.

263
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:24,000
How do you know my bride?

264
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,000
Here.

265
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
Thanks.

266
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
In.

267
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Oh you!

268
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,000
I'm on my way now.

269
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
What are you in a hurry to do?

270
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:58,000
If I find another new species.

271
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:03,000
Of course, I could still become an honorary member of the botanical society.

272
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
Hemuli!

273
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:10,000
We would like to arrange some cookies for you.

274
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
Friendly.

275
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:16,000
I've changed a lot since we last met.

276
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Now I understand what your father was trying to explain to me.

277
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:23,000
I have learned how beautiful flowers are from my uncle Hemuli.

278
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Fireworks can be just as beautiful.

279
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:31,000
Great beats and correct colors alone are not enough.

280
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:34,000
They must form a whole.

281
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
Oh, be so happy.

282
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:41,000
I finally got some cool rockets born and tried them out last night.

283
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
I am very satisfied.

284
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:46,000
Someone else saw the fireworks.

285
00:18:55,000 --> 00:19:02,000
The engaged couple decided to go to their homes, but before that they were raped by fireworks.

286
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:06,000
And in honor of Hemul, the table was set in Korean.

287
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:16,000
Dear friends, we have been touched by a great honor to have Hemul with us this beautiful evening.

288
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:24,000
Our friend has discovered a new species of palm carp, which will soon be named Hemulensis or Hemuli Formis.

289
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:28,000
Our renowned botanist will tell you in more detail in a moment.

290
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,000
Hemuli, describe the new palm.

291
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:37,000
The palm I found has sixteen sows in a row and...

292
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:52,000
Oh good, unusual, that's exactly what the new palm is like.

293
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:05,000
Hemul was thoroughly celebrated well into the night.

294
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
Thanks for watching.
