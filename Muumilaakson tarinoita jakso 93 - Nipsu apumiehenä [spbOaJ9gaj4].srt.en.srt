1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Bye.

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Dad, can you fix the roof?

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Yeah, yes I can.

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Moomin, can you hand me a board over there?

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Oh! This one?

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Just that, that long. Thank you very much.

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Wow!

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Oh! Dad, watch out! Don't fall!

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Grab something!

10
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Oh! I thought you were going to fall.

11
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
My son, I thought so myself.

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Be careful, dad.

13
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I don't have a problem anymore.

14
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Moomin! Moomin!

15
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
What are we doing here? Hey kids!

16
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Oops, the roof looked broken.

17
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
This is quite high. Just don't slide down there.

18
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
The roof is ancient. Dad built it when he was young.

19
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Papa Moomin is fixing the roof. I thought he broke it.

20
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Your opinion is not needed.

21
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Moomin Pekku, give me one more board.

22
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Oh, oh, father!

23
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Oh, father!

24
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Stupid to make the same mistake twice.

25
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Hey!

26
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Moomin Pekku, did it go bad?

27
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Hi, hi, hi!

28
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Brother, what a surprise!

29
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:41,000
I shouldn't have to continue fixing the roof anymore.

30
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,000
I thought I would finish it today.

31
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Could I fix the roof? Would you fix the roof?

32
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Don't let Nipsu fix it? The roof still needs to be watered.

33
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
You don't even know that I've studied a carpenter's correspondence course.

34
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Well then, I'll help you.

35
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:08,000
No thanks. I'll fix it myself. Trust me.

36
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Nipsu is clever, amazing.

37
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Amazing.

38
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
We'll see how it goes after the first rain.

39
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
What do you do for a living?

40
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
It also has a lot of honey.

41
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Nipsu has helped Moominpapa so much that I cut him a really big apple.

42
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Ah, wonderful. Good luck, Pekka.

43
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
That roof is still going to collapse, Nipsu.

44
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:38,000
I think it's right that Nipsu is rewarded. He worked hard.

45
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Well, it did. It's true. Now I'm hawking.

46
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Hey, wait!

47
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Hey, you can get such a big piece of hotcake at once.

48
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Myy is right. Eat the tart with pleasure.

49
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Yeah, I'll lick first then.

50
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Disgusting.

51
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Ompa sweet. And such a big piece that it feels like a salary.

52
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Well, it's a salary.

53
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:11,000
When you work for someone, you are actually working for yourself.

54
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Oh for his own good. Well, it is. True.

55
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Now what did you come up with?

56
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
To shine.

57
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Let's start helping everyone who needs help.

58
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
And it's paid for with pies and other goodies.

59
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Let's start helping.

60
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Exactly. Sell, Do you need help with something?

61
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Not in.

62
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Don't be a useless bitch. Tell me what kind of help you need, and I'll get your piece of cake next time.

63
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000
I don't need your help with anything.

64
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Moovimamma, do you have something for Riuska's helper?

65
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Any work is fine.

66
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Wait and see.

67
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
You can bake me a strawberry or cherry cake as a reward.

68
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Nipsu is completely engrossed in his invention.

69
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:59,000
The pinch was difficult before, but now it's unbearable.

70
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Hi Moovimamma, can I fetch you some water?

71
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,000
No need, thanks. I just got the laundry done.

72
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Well then I'll hang the laundry to dry.

73
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Oh shit.

74
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:15,000
I see. You have too much work. Leave them to me.

75
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Yes, but a pinch.

76
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Hi dad.

77
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Oh, he's fallen asleep.

78
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Oh, it's time to go water the flowers.

79
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Oh good time.

80
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Freshly washed laundry along the yard.

81
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Strange, the nipsuna skin had to hang the clothes on a line.

82
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
I wasted my work too.

83
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Nipsu probably didn't notice using clothespins.

84
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:55,000
I have to start doing laundry again.

85
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,000
This is for Riuska's helper.

86
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,000
If you hire me right away, you'll get a hefty discount.

87
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
What do you say?

88
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
I can't offer you any work.

89
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Me neither.

90
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Oh right. I'm not selling this.

91
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Don't tease me!

92
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Asked Nuuskamuikku for a job, if working is what you crave.

93
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Aha, Nuuska from Muikku.

94
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Hello, businessman.

95
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Nuuska Muikkunen.

96
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Hey, little one.

97
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
How are you?

98
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,000
I do business as an assistant.

99
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
You as a sidekick?

100
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Yeah. Do you have any work to offer?

101
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Everything is fine and you can give your salary...

102
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Wow, that's how tasty your hate soup is, which you tend to cook.

103
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
I can't find any work.

104
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Oh, don't say that.

105
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Yes, you will definitely find something.

106
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Not found. I do all the work myself.

107
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Don't be like that. I want nothing but honest work.

108
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Aha, now I figured it out.

109
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Uh! How unclean is the tent?

110
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Clay and grass stains all around.

111
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Of course, my tent is constantly at the mercy of rain and wind.

112
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Hey, I'll wash it for you.

113
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,000
No, no, no way. I have never washed it.

114
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Heavens, then the tent must be washed.

115
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Take the word of a professional, I know.

116
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:30,000
I'm a dashing helper, helper, helper.

117
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:35,000
I'll get a strawberry cake from Moomin mamma, and I'll take a sniff of it on the sofa.

118
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:39,000
My career as a helper is already well underway.

119
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:44,000
I'm a brisk helper, I'm sure I'll meet the moon.

120
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,000
What? Tent, where is it? Tent!

121
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:51,000
You must not run away from the tent. Come back, come back.

122
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Here, here and there.

123
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,000
You can't run away from the tent now.

124
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,000
The water is cold! I can't sleep!

125
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Help, help! What?

126
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,000
It's really low here.

127
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Hello, Nipsu. Has the tent been washed?

128
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:14,000
With Juuk, I'm washed by it. Of course, I'm going crazy, but...

129
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:20,000
The fabric was bad. I'm not taking any pay this time.

130
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Goodbye. Sorry.

131
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Hi, hi.

132
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Do we have to?

133
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Do we really have to go take care of Vilionka's children?

134
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:36,000
I fear the worst. I just went to Vilionka's place and he asked us for help.

135
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:40,000
He himself is going to greet the sick in the community.

136
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
To greet the local sick.

137
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:46,000
And there's no way you'd want to leave your children alone at home to do bad things.

138
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,000
We had other plans.

139
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Well, since we had to go to the beach now.

140
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:57,000
I don't like Vilionka and I hate his children.

141
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,000
I see. Taking care of children is exactly what I'm good at.

142
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,000
No! He doesn't know where to poke.

143
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Nipsu, as you know madam, Vilionkka is quite demanding.

144
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Good! Then of course he wants me.

145
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Maybe.

146
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
But mother Nipsu wants to go.

147
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
And Nipsu is a badass.

148
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Well, I guess that suits Mrs. Vilionka.

149
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Yes, I guess.

150
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
I will come home late at night.

151
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
That's right, ma'am.

152
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:31,000
I make sure that the children spend their time according to the reading schedule that I have prepared for them.

153
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Yes, yes ma'am.

154
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:39,000
I have raised my children so that they would always follow certain rules in their lives.

155
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
That's my motto.

156
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Right, I know, but I'd like to...

157
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
So what?

158
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
What do I get paid?

159
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Share, well, what would you like?

160
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:56,000
I would really like something good to put in my mouth, something delicious, if that's okay.

161
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
What? Fits well.

162
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:02,000
I eat as much as your stomach takes when my kids eat dinner.

163
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Lovely, as much as I want.

164
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Only if you take good care of my children.

165
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Have a nice rest of the day.

166
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Hurrah!

167
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Huh, I'm starving.

168
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
That, hey.

169
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Hey.

170
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Listen, isn't it time for dinner already?

171
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Not yet.

172
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Isn't it hard to concentrate when you have a stomach ache?

173
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Dinner is not eaten yet.

174
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:41,000
The evening snack can only be eaten when it is time.

175
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,000
It's evening and you want a snack.

176
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Let's start eating.

177
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Dinner, kids.

178
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Oh, cookies.

179
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,000
I love cookies.

180
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Our mother will never know where we wasted our time.

181
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Let's attack. Did you hear?

182
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Salty!

183
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Of course.

184
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Mom said sugar is dangerous.

185
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Do you always bring salty cookies?

186
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Joo.

187
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,000
They pay poorly.

188
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Hi, hi, hi.

189
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Moomin-Pekko is currently sitting on the tea table.

190
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:44,000
That I had to agree to babysit.

191
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Hey!

192
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Hey, I came to see how you're doing.

193
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
What are the children doing?

194
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,000
They draw on the first floor according to the reading order.

195
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Do not!

196
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:02,000
You are the babysitter for a while, I'm just fine.

197
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
You get tired easily.

198
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Please.

199
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Ah, I'm sleepy.

200
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Fine, but then you give me a piece of cake.

201
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Oh, a whole piece.

202
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Make up your mind, it takes ages.

203
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Oh no, so be it.

204
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Aha, let's make a drawing, seriously.

205
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
What exactly are you drawing?

206
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Oh, what is it?

207
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Flower.

208
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,000
I thought someone had swatted a fly at it.

209
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
I'm drawing a boat.

210
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
It can't even sail in a teacup.

211
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Ah.

212
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Why do you draw such small pictures?

213
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
This is a fish.

214
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Or fish? It is so small that a Worm could eat it.

215
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Think big things.

216
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Draw big pictures.

217
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,000
If the drawing goes wrong, take a new paper.

218
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Or little souls draw little pictures.

219
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Increase size.

220
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
So big, huh?

221
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
No, no, no, not at all.

222
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Your paper is too small.

223
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Draw here.

224
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
What do you get for that?

225
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Yes, yes.

226
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Nobody, or a boat, or a fish.

227
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
No matter how big.

228
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
What is this?

229
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:23,000
The challenge is to be happy and let yourself be free.

230
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Maybe you are already too free.

231
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Free and obedient children are the best.

232
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Moomin, Troll.

233
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
What are you talking about?

234
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,000
We came to see how things are going here.

235
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Tell me right away what has happened to Nipsu.

236
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Nipsu got tired of protecting the children.

237
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,000
He's snoring over there on the couch in the living room.

238
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
And he broke his promise.

239
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
So you're in a pinch.

240
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
That's right.

241
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Hey, I think we definitely have to get out of here.

242
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Because just believe me.

243
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Tell me why.

244
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
So why.

245
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Don't tell.

246
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Well, let's start sinking. Run.

247
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Hrrrrrrrrrrrr

248
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Have a good sleep.

249
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
It's quiet.

250
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
The seller does his job well.

251
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Hi Myy. Thank you for...

252
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Father!

253
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Oh no.

254
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,000
The floor, walls, pits get a surface.

255
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,000
The adopted ones tore all the places.

256
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
This is no joke.

257
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:44,000
No mother can think these are beautiful.

258
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:51,000
If Viljonkka sees the storms, then my reputation is gone.

259
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Hi, hi, hi, hi, hi, hi!

260
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
What did I do?

261
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
What can I do?

262
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Yay!

263
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Luuska Moikkusen's tent.

264
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Ain't screw it up, kid.

265
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
I know, let's make it beautiful.

266
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Well, big lines.

267
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Huh, Viljonka's children, are you all helpers?

268
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,000
I'm not, I'm just helping out a bit.

269
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Sell, I can't see Viljonka's children.

270
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Well, that's horrible.

271
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,000
They have moved on since we were talking.

272
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Hello, Luuska the little boy.

273
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Oh, my, this piece fits that.

274
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:58,000
I hope Viljonkka doesn't notice that the statue is glued.

275
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:02,000
About, carefully, about.

276
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:07,000
I have to go see what the kids are doing before Viljonka comes back.

277
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
About.

278
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
I can't believe my eyes.

279
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Oh rot.

280
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Again, delay.

281
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
You are exactly what we were told.

282
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
How long have they already reached?

283
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Oh, there they are.

284
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
There was nothing to worry about.

285
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Hey, let's see.

286
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Hey, let's see.

287
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
There was nothing to worry about.

288
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Kids are just having fun.

289
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Let's go along.

290
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
I'm running.

291
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
They really enjoy rowing.

292
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
For once they are happy.

293
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Are you in rowing boats for the first time?

294
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
Yeah, we are.

295
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,000
First time.

296
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Mom is afraid to let us out to the playground.

297
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Dangerous.

298
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:24,000
But today you can row as long as you want.

299
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,000
Shall we pick up the pace?

300
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
Mummy!

301
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Mene will be crushed if Moomin doesn't stop it.

302
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
Precautionary!

303
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
No, Moomin, you're about to crash.

304
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Hey, hurry up, Mummy.

305
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
I'm a warning.

306
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
Issue.

307
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000
No wait.

308
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000
I will come.

309
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,000
Terrible, how do we get through this?

310
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
Something has to be done, I don't know what, but something has to be done.

311
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Help, come help, help, help.

312
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
You here, where are Viljonka's children?

313
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,000
Oh shit, you don't even know.

314
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
The children are in trouble for Pinte and so is Mumipeikka.

315
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
Hold on.

316
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Keep calm.

317
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Viljonka probably didn't expect this.

318
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Do something, don't procrastinate.

319
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Me?

320
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
No, no, I can't swim, you know that.

321
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
And you had to be a badass sidekick.

322
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
It's not my fault that I hate water.

323
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Help, help, great luck on my beach, come help.

324
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
Well, yes, I can shout for help too.

325
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,000
You are of no use.

326
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Shipwreck, children in distress at sea, help.

327
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Nipsu, what happened?

328
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,000
Oh, snuff, little one.

329
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,000
Speed, speed, speed.

330
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Tasteless Peikko.

331
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,000
Can you stay afloat?

332
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
Sniff the little one, get the rope.

333
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,000
Catch up.

334
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
Well, hey, grab the rope.

335
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,000
Clear.

336
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Don't worry, just hold on to the tire.

337
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,000
Prepare.

338
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Well, let's start pulling now.

339
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,000
Well, now.

340
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,000
No.

341
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,000
Thanks for the help.

342
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,000
This is lovely.

343
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:54,000
Nuuska Muikkunen's delicious soup is the best.

344
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,000
Hot and tasty.

345
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,000
Delicious.

346
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
Do you like my vegetable guide that much?

347
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,000
Are you a vegetable?

348
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Namely.

349
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
Surprising carrots.

350
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,000
I hate onions.

351
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,000
You must be paprika.

352
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:16,000
But you ate them all and praised the soup for its good taste.

353
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,000
Yeah, it tasted good.

354
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,000
For real good.

355
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:26,000
Oh, and you hate carrots, onions and green peppers.

356
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:32,000
Our mother never puts carrots, onions or peppers in the soup.

357
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:37,000
Well, how would you describe this vegetable guide in a few words?

358
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,000
Good, how good.

359
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,000
And then close your eyes.

360
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
Huh, are my kids there?

361
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,000
A pinch.

362
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,000
Hey hey.

363
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,000
A pinch.

364
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,000
Mother.

365
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,000
Vili Junkka.

366
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,000
Vili Junkka.

367
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,000
Welcome back.

368
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,000
What owes an explanation?

369
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:09,000
You wrap my children in raggedy blankets and feed them suspicious-looking broth.

370
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,000
Vili Junkka.

371
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
Dear Madam, I can explain everything.

372
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
I don't want to hear any more emergency lies.

373
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,000
I will never ask you to babysit again.

374
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,000
We're going home now.

375
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,000
Joo.

376
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,000
There was no praise.

377
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,000
Not so.

378
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
Thank you for today.

379
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,000
We had a lot of fun.

380
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,000
Come play again.

381
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,000
what are you doing

382
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,000
Get out of there!

383
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,000
Yes mom.

384
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:50,000
I wouldn't be surprised at all, even if this was the happiest day of those children.

385
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:54,000
Nipsu, I guess you're going to play with them again?

386
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
Being a babysitter...

387
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
I remembered exactly what I had to do.

388
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,000
Oh no.

389
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
I guess there's nothing more that can be done about it.

390
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,000
Let it be, Nipsu.

391
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:14,000
Forget the whole thing and start worrying and only tomorrow when Vili who comes to complain.

392
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,000
No, don't be scared.

393
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:20,000
And if you need a helper, you don't have to try me.

394
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
Thanks for watching!
