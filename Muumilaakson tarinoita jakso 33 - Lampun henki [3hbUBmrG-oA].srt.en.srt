1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Moomin troll

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Miss Niisku runs happily towards the Moomin house.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
He plans to go to the beach with Moomin.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Moomin!

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:25,000
The Moomin

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Ah, the sun is already rising and tells about that step.

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Kehveli.

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
No... see...

9
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Dad, what's wrong with you?

10
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Yes?

11
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Well what about you?

12
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
It sounded like you had been raining.

13
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Yes?

14
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Ha ha!

15
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
I am currently writing a play.

16
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
A play?

17
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
The previous play was a great success.

18
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I savored the turns.

19
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Ah, the sun is already rising and it's telling there steps.

20
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Nice line, but could it be improved?

21
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Rosalina.

22
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
To the heavy basket.

23
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Moomin!

24
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Really cute.

25
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Ha ha ha!

26
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Did you find something?

27
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Well, nothing to mention.

28
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Oh beautiful.

29
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Are you still empty-handed?

30
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
I'll go look elsewhere.

31
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
I think this is definitely the best place.

32
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
I'll go somewhere else.

33
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Ha ha!

34
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Oh how wonderful.

35
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Moomin, what are you doing?

36
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Well, at least it's not invisible now.

37
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
There isn't.

38
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Moomin!

39
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Moomin!

40
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Well, at least that's not the case now.

41
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Well, no.

42
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Why did you dig it up?

43
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
I have to see what it is.

44
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Looks like an old item.

45
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Not too weird.

46
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Now it already looks like something.

47
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
I've dusted it off.

48
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
It's an old lamp.

49
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Alatid's magic lamp.

50
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Now don't bother, little lady.

51
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Don't rub the lamp yet?

52
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Tried not put.

53
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Moomin!

54
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Wow! No fuss.

55
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
The magic lamp is just a fairy tale.

56
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Well, I can try.

57
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Don't mock.

58
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
To tell the truth, I'm already rubbing the lamp into my numb hands,

59
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
but no spirit appeared from there.

60
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
You didn't massage properly.

61
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Men can't even whip cream.

62
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000
At the same time, you have to cast some kind of spell,

63
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
for example hipsis, hopsis, genihoi,

64
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
came out of the lamp.

65
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
That's not a real spell.

66
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Say, Sesame is coming out.

67
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
The sky is awful.

68
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Watch out, little lady!

69
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Jaha, how may I serve, sir?

70
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Did you come out of this lamp?

71
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
I came.

72
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Are you the real spirit of the lamp?

73
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Of course.

74
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
In the fairy tale book, the spirit of the lamp has a different appearance.

75
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:55,000
I testify that I am the spirit of the lamp, if you must.

76
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
No, maybe the picture in the book is bad.

77
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
I am the only true spirit of the lamp.

78
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
I am the only true spirit of the lamp.

79
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Then you can make any wish come true.

80
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Their wish, not yours.

81
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
I dug you out of the sand.

82
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
It doesn't matter at all.

83
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Miss called me from the lamp.

84
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
What are we going to do now?

85
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Ask spirit for something we've always wanted.

86
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Wait a minute...

87
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Kalkor!

88
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Their wish will come true.

89
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Wait!

90
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,000
I still haven't had time to say what kind of necklace I want.

91
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,000
If you don't like it, send the jewelry back.

92
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:45,000
If I like the necklace brought by the spirit, then you get to wish for something next.

93
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Clear.

94
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Where did you rub the lamp?

95
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
From here.

96
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Very, very average.

97
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Aha.

98
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Hips, hops, spirit, hoi.

99
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Out of the lamp hummed.

100
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Hey.

101
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
The spirit returned.

102
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Miss is good.

103
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Beyond belief.

104
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
That's exactly what I thought.

105
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Thank you spirit of the lamp.

106
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
It won't last, good lady.

107
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
I'm just doing my job.

108
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Are you sneaking back into the lamp now?

109
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Yes.

110
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Then hurry up, I'll let you out next.

111
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
I would like to ask you a favor.

112
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Wait a minute.

113
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:45,000
If it's difficult to walk between the lamp and the outside air, you can hear my wish right away.

114
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:49,000
It doesn't work, I have to be called out every time separately.

115
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
I'll save you the trouble.

116
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
You can't hope right away.

117
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Why not?

118
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,000
I can only grant one wish a week.

119
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
I need rest sometimes.

120
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Just like that, fulfilling wishes is of course terribly exhausting.

121
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,000
It's not that I'm not capable.

122
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
I can do many things.

123
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Like what?

124
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
It's a secret.

125
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Moomin-Pekka, don't tell anyone about the magic lamp.

126
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Of course not.

127
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Day.

128
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
The names mean nothing.

129
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Five tulips or hydrangea.

130
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Something about it.

131
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,000
I'm not a wretched knee or a thimble flower here.

132
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Hopeless.

133
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Thank Aladdin that I didn't tell the kids that I could get to midnight from the lamp on my own.

134
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Otherwise, I wouldn't have had much peace.

135
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Good thing I can read minds.

136
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,000
So I know what you wish for.

137
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:45,000
It's nauseating. No wonder the young man has worries.

138
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
I'll rewrite the scene.

139
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Come on, play someone else.

140
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,000
It must be rewritten.

141
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:58,000
After all, the whole page is entertaining us with stupid things.

142
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Who's here?

143
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
I am Finland.

144
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
I am Finland.

145
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Don't bother us with nonsense.

146
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
What a paralyze.

147
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Who has done this?

148
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Mamma, you haven't been there.

149
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Someone tampered with my text.

150
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Why, counsel?

151
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,000
What am I asking and still in the middle of the night?

152
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Well, even that is remarkable.

153
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Moomin, it wasn't you, was it?

154
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
I don't know anything.

155
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Of course not, aah, who who!

156
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Ugly trick, I'm not at all surprised you're hurt.

157
00:08:52,000 --> 00:09:00,000
A pretty ugly trick, especially when the repairs have been made to areas that I knew needed polishing.

158
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Paappa, you can write well enough yourself.

159
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Yes, but when my play got better from corrections.

160
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Well then, be grateful.

161
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Exactly, no no, a playwright can't be a basket case.

162
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Oops, they tasted like a necklace, if you like pearls.

163
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Hi, thank you, I got the necklace as a gift.

164
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Very beautiful, can I try it?

165
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Just trying it on, I'm sure it will wear you too.

166
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Maybe you'll learn to like it from strings of pearls.

167
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,000
I will ask you for a similar string of pearls.

168
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Do you have a friend, Antelias?

169
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Oh, my, I've searched the whole house, but it's nowhere to be found.

170
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:54,000
No need to worry, Rovabilionkka, the thief will surely be caught.

171
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Good day, police chief.

172
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Well, day.

173
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Hurry up so my thief doesn't run away from the Moomin trap.

174
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Oh good time, catch the thief already.

175
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Calm down, Rovabilionkka.

176
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Has something been stolen from Rovabilionka?

177
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
There is a string of pearls.

178
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:18,000
It has 87 beautiful pearls, just like you.

179
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Little sells.

180
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
You can't, don't.

181
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Incredibly hot, the string of pearls is my thief caught.

182
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
What?

183
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Stop it.

184
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Petty crooks are often the biggest of all.

185
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,000
This string of pearls belongs to niiskunneids.

186
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:41,000
When you laugh, you're trying to shove the blame on the necks of the niggers.

187
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,000
I am not called a thief without consequences.

188
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Niskunneid's necks?

189
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,000
I am not called a thief without consequences.

190
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Niiskunmi, are you sure the string of pearls is yours?

191
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,000
There is. I got it as a gift.

192
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
From whom?

193
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
It's a secret between Moomin and me.

194
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Secret?

195
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Nua brats have stolen my pearl necklace.

196
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Rovalionkka, they never light up.

197
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
It is not preached in the church.

198
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Their shell is messy and dusty.

199
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
No need to drag.

200
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,000
You will regret it if you get in between.

201
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,000
I want to ask you one thing.

202
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Ai! Ai!

203
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Like they're already off.

204
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:32,000
The spirit is at home.

205
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:42,000
I don't know who has been on it, but he is clearly a pencil sharpener.

206
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Just listen to this, snuff mumbler.

207
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Ah, already Auriko is getting up and Kerttu is walking there.

208
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Now that didn't sound so great.

209
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
No, I wrote like that.

210
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Oh, sorry.

211
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:01,000
No problem. This way it is fixed.

212
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:06,000
The light that shines through the window is east and Juulia is the sun.

213
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Get up in a charming day and slay the envious moon.

214
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Tired and worn out from grief.

215
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
What daybreak?

216
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,000
How to cleverly change Kertu's name to juuli?

217
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
It's much more romantic.

218
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:25,000
The heroine is worried because the parents do not approve of her beloved ethekar.

219
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
I had written like this.

220
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Names mean nothing, tulip or hydrangea five of them.

221
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,000
But listen to this, where is the meaning of the name.

222
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:38,000
What is called a rose would smell just as sweet by another name.

223
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Oh my gosh!

224
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:44,000
So does Roomeo, even if it has been given a different name.

225
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Nicely said, even if I had left out Romeo's scent.

226
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:52,000
The promising author said it right, papa.

227
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:57,000
A lot of words, maybe, but Roomeo is a good name for a hero.

228
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Leave a note for the author to continue your play.

229
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Maybe it's not that necessary after all.

230
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:10,000
He knows that all good corrections appear at midnight, when I was in a sound sleep.

231
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:15,000
I'm sitting at your desk, right?

232
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:20,000
There are people who wander in their sleep, remembering nothing the next morning.

233
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
You mean sleepwalkers?

234
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:26,000
You were very sleepy when you woke up this morning.

235
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Ha ha, sleepier than usual, that's right.

236
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:35,000
When did you wake up in the middle of the night and correct the play in your sleep?

237
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Some little things in my play had been bothering me.

238
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:47,000
I have literary talents hidden in my subconscious, which I'm sure you are aware of.

239
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Oh, they came to my rescue so that I rushed to my study in the middle of the night,

240
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:58,000
I grabbed the pen in full sleep and unleashed my gift.

241
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
This is it.

242
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Now this is the first lamp in my possession, you can do anything.

243
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:13,000
No wait! Stop! Told you to stop, did you hear?

244
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Police! Heavens, how do you know to chase the menu?

245
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
The bird of bad air is disappearing!

246
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Disappear yourself! I guess you'll regret it! I'm being chased! The police are on their heels!

247
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Wedding? Sell stops!

248
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Put you on the tube stops!

249
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Oh, they give me chills!

250
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:37,000
I know why you were in a hurry! You stole what you hold!

251
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:40,000
What's up with you? Not yours!

252
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:45,000
No, but somebody's got it! So yes it belongs to me!

253
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Thief! Catch the thief!

254
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Give it back!

255
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,000
That's the lamp I found.

256
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Did you get me to bite you too?

257
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Our lamp.

258
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Oh grandma, Peikka, Stinker walked like a magic lamp.

259
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Heavens, Stink mustn't take the lamp, or something terrible will happen.

260
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Did you hear the hum? It's supposed to be a magic lamp.

261
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
After!

262
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Police Chief, catch Myy!

263
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Stink, run over here and I'll help you.

264
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Turn, come back! Did you hear? Shoot ours!

265
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Give it back!

266
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:31,000
This lamp is my manger from the beginning, I will not part with this.

267
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
I succeeded!

268
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
Are you the spirit of the lamp?

269
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
I am, my Lord.

270
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Or sir?

271
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,000
I let the spirit out of the lamp.

272
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
I am his master now.

273
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
I can't believe it.

274
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Tales of a thousand and one nights.

275
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Unbelievable, but true.

276
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:06,000
I saw when Niskunnetti asked the spirit of the lamp for a pearl for herself.

277
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Oh, just like that.

278
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
Miss wanted Pramea's necklace.

279
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:16,000
I have to think about what I would come up with to ask.

280
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:21,000
Listen Stink, the spirit can only grant one wish a week.

281
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
It's not true!

282
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,000
May I ask where you stole the string of pearls from?

283
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,000
I stole.

284
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Well, or where did you get it?

285
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
Apurista.

286
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Mrs. Viljonka from the house?

287
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
I don't know who lives there.

288
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
The spirit stole the string of pearls.

289
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Well, stealing is easier.

290
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:45,000
I want a magic key that opens bank vaults.

291
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:48,000
I have a few questions.

292
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:52,000
A sack of gold wouldn't be half as much fun.

293
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Did you make corrections to papa's play?

294
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
I? The text was so flat.

295
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,000
You don't just need to grind.

296
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:06,000
Besides, this young Moomik was also worried about the play.

297
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:09,000
He wished his father success.

298
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Moomin troll.

299
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Then there would be no need to break into the profession with pride.

300
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:20,000
Father, I saw how you suffered in your play.

301
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
I hope it will be good.

302
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:26,000
But of course I don't want Lampu's spirit to write your play.

303
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
I want the key!

304
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:32,000
That's right, Lampu's spirit didn't come up with corrections on its own.

305
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Didn't the text sound somehow familiar?

306
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
Oh, right.

307
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:43,000
The spirit of the lamp lent you excerpts from a play by a world-famous author.

308
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
Oh, miserable me.

309
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
I've read a lot.

310
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
I'm going back to Lampu now.

311
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:53,000
No wait, I want to make you a wish.

312
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
I beg your pardon, good sir.

313
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:58,000
See you next week.

314
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Next week.

315
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,000
Not next week, not next month.

316
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
Not next year, not ever.

317
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
The lamp is not your skunk.

318
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
And besides, I know what you wish for.

319
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
Universal key.

320
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
Uh, I'm going to hide the Lamp.

321
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:22,000
But there is no place where I can't find it.

322
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:28,000
Moomin, Lampu is too shy to be kept here.

323
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,000
Yeh, you're right.

324
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:35,000
Nuska, muikkunen, what are we going to do with Lampu?

325
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
A week is expenses.

326
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
The police chief is coming!

327
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,000
Snuff, muikkunen, let's start.

328
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
Manager!

329
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
Yeh, you're right.

330
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
Yeh, you're right.

331
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Yeh, you're right.

332
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:19,000
Or again, what do you want now?

333
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
Can you bring the Magician here?

334
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:24,000
Or the Magician, of course.

335
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:35,000
What do you have for the Magician?

336
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:41,000
I think that a safe place for Lampu can only be found on another planet.

337
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:45,000
And only the Magician can take the Lamp there, no one else.

338
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:50,000
It was hard work, the Magician will be here soon.

339
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
Oh, thank you.

340
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,000
Well, see you again in a week.

341
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:15,000
The magician agreed to take the Magic Lamp to an unknown star.

342
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
And it was good.

343
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:21,000
It would be boring if all wishes came true.
