1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
It will be a beautiful day again.

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Hat mats. They are busy.

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Moomin troll. Moomin troll.

4
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
What mom?

5
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
This is already ripe.

6
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Not yet. Wait for the color to turn golden brown.

7
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I want everything to happen quickly.

8
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Oh.

9
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Don't push it when it's almost possible to break the egg.

10
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Don't strain.

11
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Succeeded.

12
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
So.

13
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
What are you doing?

14
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Moomin troll.

15
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Don't ask stupid questions. Do you have eyes in your head?

16
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Little sells, cooking.

17
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Oh, pancake night. Oh, do you also sell them fried?

18
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Are they even edible?

19
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Pointless, doubt it.

20
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,000
I was thinking of learning how to cook because I've reached marriageable age.

21
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Are you that old already?

22
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
The pancakes are ready.

23
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
A pinch, no. Do not touch.

24
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
I can taste your blood.

25
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Tapping.

26
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
It's not my fault.

27
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Fear of salt.

28
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Water.

29
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
I accidentally replaced sugar with salt.

30
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
So when mom is a jerk.

31
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Mom, what business did you have with me?

32
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Share, always.

33
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Would you be so kind as to fetch some blueberry jam from the basement?

34
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
I have to stay in the kitchen now.

35
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
It's okay, mom. A pinch of fire.

36
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
I thought I was going to die.

37
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
How did Moomin mama let the mouse into the kitchen?

38
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
That you are, incorruptible?

39
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Blueberry, blueberry.

40
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
I'd bet that I get worse.

41
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
A pinch.

42
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
I was joking.

43
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Some paper roll.

44
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
It looks pretty old.

45
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Keen drawing.

46
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
As if a child had scratched.

47
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
In my opinion, it could be some kind of map.

48
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
In my opinion, it could be some kind of map.

49
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
In my opinion, it could be some kind of map.

50
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Some map.

51
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
I guess there is a path there.

52
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
And those are the lonely mountains.

53
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Really.

54
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
But what example is this?

55
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Hi, I'll bring you some tea.

56
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Here's the blueberry jam.

57
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Oh, thanks to the running boys.

58
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
What paper is there?

59
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Some map probably.

60
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
It was found behind the jam jars.

61
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Do you know who did it?

62
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Yeah, I don't think so.

63
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
But Moominpappa could know.

64
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
True.

65
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Nipsu, let's go ask dad.

66
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Joo.

67
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Don't disturb dad's writing?

68
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Don't disturb dad's writing?

69
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
No, no.

70
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Dad, Do you know anything about this map?

71
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Dad, Do you know anything about this map?

72
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
It looks like a treasure map.

73
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
It looks like a treasure map.

74
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Phooey.

75
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Is that a treasure map?

76
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
And we found it.

77
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Gold and precious stones.

78
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Dad, do you think we can find the hidden treasure?

79
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Couldn't you take a closer look at the map?

80
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
The map must be old.

81
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Tell me, where is the treasure hidden?

82
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Moomin, I've been inspired for a while.

83
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Couldn't you shut up?

84
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Father please.

85
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
The treasure is hidden here.

86
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Great, Nipsu.

87
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
It is.

88
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Today's program has been decided.

89
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Let's go.

90
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Well, let's go.

91
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Do you have everything?

92
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,000
There's a rope, a shovel, a flashlight, a cauldron and...

93
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
The heads are in the backpack.

94
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
It is.

95
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Please renew.

96
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Luckily we made it.

97
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Eat a little before you go.

98
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Maybe when we come.

99
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Hey hey.

100
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Don't go yet.

101
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,000
And we baked pancakes for them in a sweat hat.

102
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
That they dare.

103
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
About the abuser.

104
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
What makes you laugh?

105
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,000
They can't escape the pancakes.

106
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:17,000
I packed a few pancakes for them in the backpack.

107
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Don't you.

108
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
I packed.

109
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
The search for Haarte is exciting.

110
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Romantic for adventurers.

111
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Aptly said.

112
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:35,000
What are you going to do with your share of the girdle, Moomin?

113
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Have you had time to think?

114
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:43,000
I would like to buy a big sailboat and sail it around the world.

115
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,000
I keep my treasure under the bed.

116
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
It's hard to eat.

117
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
A good time, not with such a big fire.

118
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
This won't work.

119
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Stop breaking the eggs and go get water from the well instead.

120
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Clear.

121
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,000
How did this happen?

122
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
What?

123
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
What's going on here?

124
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Hello, friends.

125
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Good morning, Nuuska Muikkunen.

126
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Good morning.

127
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Where are you going when you have so much stuff?

128
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
To find the treasure.

129
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Aaretta, above.

130
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Really.

131
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
We found this map in the jam cellar.

132
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Is this where your treasure is?

133
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Yep, it's hidden in the place indicated by the sign.

134
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Aha, at the foot of a lonely pine tree.

135
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Do you know that place?

136
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:43,000
That pine tree grows on the highest place in Moomin Valley.

137
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:48,000
And since it's the tallest tree there, lightning often strikes it.

138
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Hattivats gather there during thunderstorms.

139
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Hat mats.

140
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,000
What does this mean?

141
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Not even a hint.

142
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,000
This, this is war.

143
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
What war?

144
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
What do we do now?

145
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,000
We have been besieged by the Hattivats.

146
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
They were going to conquer the Moomin house.

147
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Oh no, don't, I guess not.

148
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Look at the eyes of the hatties.

149
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:30,000
They usually don't have such a wild look.

150
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Not about you?

151
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,000
I don't notice anything unusual.

152
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Seems to me they have a point.

153
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Aha, well now I know.

154
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Don't go boom mom!

155
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Don't rush.

156
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Let me pass through.

157
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Curious thing!

158
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Hat rugs are giving way.

159
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Oh, that's why the shoe squeezes.

160
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,000
You want water, don't you?

161
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Wait a minute.

162
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Oh heaven!

163
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
A small hole.

164
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Aha, one Hattivatti had apparently fallen into the trap.

165
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Or so?

166
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:33,000
I thought it would never go wrong with a hat.

167
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Papa, would you pour some water to praise?

168
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Without a doubt, mom.

169
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:43,000
So, Eiti, bring the blanket and sell the doctor's book.

170
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,000
No Moomin, Pekko, let's rest sometimes.

171
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Oh again, that would be the third time.

172
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Yeah, but now I'm suddenly hungry.

173
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Let's bark sometimes.

174
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Hopefully.

175
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Bitch!

176
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Bitch!

177
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Bitch!

178
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Bitch!

179
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Bitch!

180
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Bitch!

181
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Bitch!

182
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,460
Win

183
00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:15,000
Hopeless.

184
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Is there a long way to Aar-Tee at mp.m WH?

185
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:23,300
I would guess that we will come to the big Männy very soon.

186
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:26,300
Zzaaa, Aar-Tee? Now it requires a lot.

187
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Otherwise, there wouldn't be any fun in it.

188
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,000
I guess it won't start raining.

189
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Is it better now? Can you walk?

190
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Hello Hattimatti! Why don't you say anything?

191
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Take care of yourself.

192
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Take care of yourself.

193
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Good, he seems fine.

194
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Who said that the Hattivats came to take over the Moomin House.

195
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Well, it doesn't matter anymore, Moominpapa.

196
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
So what?

197
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Where are Hattivats on their way?

198
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Probably in the lonely mountains that big pine tree that Lightning often strikes.

199
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Phooey!

200
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:38,000
You see, Hattivats charge themselves with electricity in the Ukkose.

201
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:43,000
One of the Hattvates apparently slipped into the well from the electric power.

202
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Pretty interesting stuff. Where are Moomin and Nipsu?

203
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Oh terrible! Now they are in trouble!

204
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Jaa.

205
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:00,000
That must be the lonely one on the pine map.

206
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Yes, but where is the Aare?

207
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:06,000
If there is also a small tick drawn on the ground.

208
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Alright, let's start looking.

209
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Joo.

210
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Did Moomin go with Nipsu to the lonely mountains?

211
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Lahti. He went to find a hand.

212
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
It's a lonely turn.

213
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
It's a lonely turn.

214
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
It's a lonely turn.

215
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
It's a lonely turn.

216
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Lahti. He went in search of the hidden Aaretta.

217
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Or Aaretta? What the hell Aaretta?

218
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Oh dear, you yourself told the children that that old piece of paper is the Aare map.

219
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Aare map.

220
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Well, exactly.

221
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
What happened now?

222
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Oh, that's bad.

223
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
What's the bad thing?

224
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,000
To be honest, there is no such thing as Aaretta.

225
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
What?

226
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,000
I hear what you mean?

227
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Can't find anything here.

228
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,000
At least I can't see Aaretta.

229
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Moomin, do we have to dig up the whole hill?

230
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:22,000
It would be such a terrible job that I can't handle it at least.

231
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Eh?

232
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Hats, and we don't even have umbrellas with us.

233
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
What do we do now?

234
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
At least let's get out of the rain.

235
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Oh this misery.

236
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Yes, I did.

237
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Dad, you're just not going to go out in this weather.

238
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Aion.

239
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Even wait for the rain to stop.

240
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
It may be late.

241
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
What do you mean?

242
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Moomipeikko and Nipsu went to the big pine tree that really attracts lightning in the air of a thunderstorm.

243
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:13,000
If they've gone under a pine tree to catch the rain, anything can happen.

244
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Oh no.

245
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
I'll come too.

246
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Me too.

247
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
No.

248
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
We'll stay here and wait.

249
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Moomi papa can go out into the rain alone.

250
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Come on, I'm leaving now.

251
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Don't worry.

252
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Be careful.

253
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Moomi Pappa said, you are not aarita.

254
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
What exactly did it mean?

255
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
I hate this air.

256
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
I hate, I hate.

257
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
I don't even mention it.

258
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
I don't hate, I don't hate, I don't hate.

259
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Nipsu straightens up.

260
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
The thunder is already going further.

261
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Is it going?

262
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Miserable.

263
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
No treasure.

264
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,000
It's raining in buckets and Thunder is rolling.

265
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Lightning strikes the eye.

266
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
The thunder is already going further.

267
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Is it going?

268
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Miserable.

269
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
No treasure.

270
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:18,000
It's raining in buckets and Thunder is rolling.

271
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Lightning strikes the eye blind.

272
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Painu arrested, Ukkonilmaa.

273
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Help!

274
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Mummy, Dress!

275
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Hi, hi.

276
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
I'm lost in this rain.

277
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Hey!

278
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Ai.

279
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Which children would be wise to stay away from the big pine tree?

280
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Tule!

281
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Oh man, they'd be saved.

282
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Well, sure enough, they'll be saved.

283
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Moomipapa went to help.

284
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
So yeah.

285
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
You still doubt.

286
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:29,000
But Nipsu must be terribly hungry.

287
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
So.

288
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,000
I'm hungry.

289
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:41,000
I forbade you to eat all the snacks right away.

290
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,000
But when I got hungry.

291
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,000
I don't have anything either.

292
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:54,000
I don't remember putting this package in my backpack.

293
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Pancakes!

294
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Pancakes!

295
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Niiskunneiti has packed them along.

296
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,000
The famous barking.

297
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Time for salt.

298
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
That's it.

299
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
It is.

300
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
2p wins.

301
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Nothing.

302
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Hat mats. What are they doing?

303
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
Healthy I know.

304
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
You look over there.

305
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:54,000
They're coming at us.

306
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
I'm afraid.

307
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
How are we doing?

308
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
Help!

309
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Take it easy.

310
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:28,000
The pine tree grows at the highest point in Moomin Valley.

311
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Since it is the tallest tree there, Lightning often strikes it.

312
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:37,000
Hattivats gather there during thunderstorms.

313
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Oh no.

314
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
What did you remember now?

315
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:46,000
A pinch under the legs. Lightning strikes this tree.

316
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,000
That's the pine tree. Oh no.

317
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
Oh.

318
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Oh wonder.

319
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
Moomin troll.

320
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Father. Father.

321
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
Moomin troll.

322
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
Father.

323
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
Moomin troll.

324
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
Father.

325
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
I am so relieved.

326
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
I was very worried.

327
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
Father.

328
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
Moomin troll.

329
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
Moomin troll.

330
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
Moomin troll.

331
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
Moomin troll.

332
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
Moomin troll.

333
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
I am so worried.

334
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
Father.

335
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:20,000
Hattivats absorbed all the electricity from Salama.

336
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
It saved us.

337
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:27,000
So that the Hattivats now in turn helped us.

338
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:30,000
I don't understand. What do you mean?

339
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:35,000
Every family seems to have a boy who gets into trouble.

340
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
How beautiful.

341
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:48,000
So. The glow of Hattivatie is the same as before.

342
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,000
Oh, have you seen it before?

343
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
In.

344
00:19:53,000 --> 00:20:01,000
When I first came to Moomin Valley, I drew an accurate map of this area so that I would know how to come back.

345
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:05,000
If I could remember seeing that glow again.

346
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
Or so.

347
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:10,000
So that the Aare on this map is...

348
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,000
That wondrous glow, that's right.

349
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:26,000
Muus-Pekko! Muus-Pekko!

350
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:48,000
Moomin Pekko! The food is ready.

351
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
I will come.

352
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,120
Don't be sarcastic, Nipsu.

353
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:55,760
I'm serious. This is you!

354
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:57,440
Sell! Ouch! Do not!

355
00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:00,720
It's you, it's the dining table. You don't argue with children.

356
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:04,640
Ouch! Sell, you didn't pull Nipsu by the tail, but at me.

357
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:08,280
Sorry. This is a real tail. Ouch! That's my tail.

358
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:10,000
Myy! Who!

359
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:12,000
Don't be sarcastic, Nipsu.

360
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:14,480
I'm serious. This is you!

361
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:16,000
Sell! Ouch! Do not!

362
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:19,160
It's you, it's the dining table. You don't argue with children.

363
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:21,600
Sorry!
