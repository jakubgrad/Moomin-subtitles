1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Captain Hurme had been sailing the seas with his pirate crew for who knows how long, but he had never been caught in a storm like this before.

2
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:23,000
The ship was tossing and turning in the sea so violently that the captain was afraid it would sink at any moment.

3
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:31,000
It's too late to count now, Lifeboat Captain Hurme thought to himself as he slammed against the helm.

4
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:37,000
I know no better way to die, he cried, than to sink into the waves of the sea of my beloved enemy.

5
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:43,000
I don't care about myself, but I wish I could save the princess I kidnapped from the royal train.

6
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:49,000
I don't care about chests full of duploons, jewels and the finest silk in the world.

7
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Either princess would survive this terrible storm.

8
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Is that a good book?

9
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Terribly good.

10
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
The storm doesn't seem to be abating at all.

11
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:08,000
It wouldn't be nice to be alone in this weather. You feel safe in the Moomin house.

12
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Oh, what was that?

13
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Just as if a branch had broken.

14
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Moomin, would you read the story out loud?

15
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Can I pick up where I left off?

16
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Then tell us in your own words what has happened so far that we are missing something important.

17
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Just say the most important things.

18
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
A brave pirate.

19
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Oh, how wonderful it is when someone reads out loud.

20
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Just keep going.

21
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Captain Hurmerros and his crew have robbed the royal galley.

22
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,000
They took with them gold and jewels and also the ever-living princess.

23
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
It's an exciting story.

24
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
It is.

25
00:01:50,000 --> 00:02:00,000
The storm at night grew so fierce that the sinking of the ship seemed almost inevitable at first.

26
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Pretty well made.

27
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,000
The captain noticed that the princess had passed out.

28
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:13,000
He was alone and scared below deck, with only a roper for company.

29
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
The howl of the storm was unbearable.

30
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
The ship launched at the start.

31
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
All the captain could think about was the princess'sâ€¦

32
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Mamma, would you make some tea?

33
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Would you like me to bring a cup to the study?

34
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
I quit today.

35
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Children will surely like it too.

36
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Reading makes you thirsty.

37
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
You read very fluently.

38
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
An exciting book.

39
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Could I have a glass of raspberry juice?

40
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
When is Niisku coming home?

41
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,000
He didn't say, but I think he will soon.

42
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:53,000
It's good that Miss Niisku came to us while she's traveling.

43
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Or what, father?

44
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Necessarily.

45
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:59,000
It wouldn't be nice to be alone on a Stormy night like this.

46
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Not so.

47
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
It seems to be sinking.

48
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
It won't last much longer.

49
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
The crew must be secured.

50
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
We can't get the boat out in this weather.

51
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Are there any survivors?

52
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
No one has been seen yet.

53
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Have you raked the beach?

54
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Can you see anyone there?

55
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Well, at least we haven't heard that.

56
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Please keep me posted.

57
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Listen, Niisku.

58
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
what did you say

59
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
The mast of the ship seems to be flying the main flag.

60
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:47,000
I'm pretty sure I also heard the bang of the hammer.

61
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Are you kidding me?

62
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
I'm not kidding.

63
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
I can't see anything.

64
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:55,000
You can't see any headshots from this far.

65
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
You look at this.

66
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Or, are you far away?

67
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
I can't see anything.

68
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:05,000
You can't see any headshots from this far.

69
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
You look at this.

70
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Oh, do you have a telescope?

71
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
You should have said earlier.

72
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Hey, look.

73
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Now it seems to sink.

74
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Do you see anyone?

75
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Do you see anything?

76
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
What's going on?

77
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
It's not true.

78
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
It sank there.

79
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Pirate ships seem to be quite rare these days.

80
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Even the few ones are certainly terribly old.

81
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Now, if it was a pirate ship, at least that's what it looked like.

82
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
But nothing happened to Rana.

83
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Nothing at all.

84
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:59,000
It's funny that I read that pirate book just yesterday.

85
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Books and reality must be far from each other.

86
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:06,000
In Perja, the life of pirates seemed pretty bleak.

87
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Really?

88
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
It would be cool to be a pirate.

89
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Are you serious?

90
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Yes I am.

91
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:17,000
I would sail all seas and search for treasures.

92
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:21,000
But the treasures have been stolen from others.

93
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Well, that seems to be the case.

94
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,000
But I wouldn't steal.

95
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Then you'd be just a sailor.

96
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
And you're not a pirate?

97
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Do you know where Moomin might be?

98
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Probably a daring week in its tent.

99
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Really?

100
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Miss Niisku, here is a letter for you.

101
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
It seems to be from Niisku.

102
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Please.

103
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Thanks.

104
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,000
I want to read the letter right away.

105
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
I can do that.

106
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
I can do that.

107
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
What is it?

108
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Niisku writes that he will come home already today.

109
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
That's nice.

110
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:12,000
But Moomin mom, we don't have a crumb of food.

111
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Don't worry.

112
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:17,000
I'll put up a diary and Niisku can tell about his journey.

113
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Papa would definitely like to hear about it.

114
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Thanks mom.

115
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
There is a lot of food for humidity.

116
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,000
I guess he got the parts faster than he thought.

117
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Ha, good news.

118
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,000
So the aircraft will surely be ready soon.

119
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
So, I guess.

120
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Niisku should build a pirate ship.

121
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,000
I could become the tailgate and then we would fly.

122
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
We would be unreachable.

123
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
It doesn't show.

124
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Where the hell have they gone?

125
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
There's no one here either.

126
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Moomin-Pekko is definitely looking for an adventure.

127
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,000
They must be exploring the shore.

128
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Everything seems fine.

129
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Let's go to the beach of the cottage. You can find treasures there.

130
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
What now?

131
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,000
I heard some sounds.

132
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Whence?

133
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
From the inside.

134
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Weird.

135
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
It doesn't have to be, Niisku.

136
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Oh yes, Niisku. Of course.

137
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Hey Niisku.

138
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Niisku, are you here?

139
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Wet girl!

140
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
You don't want to...

141
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Was it really a pirate ship?

142
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Oh yes. And we caught the pirates when they swam ashore.

143
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Did you catch every bandit?

144
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:04,000
We don't know how many of them there really were in the beginning.

145
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:10,000
It would certainly be wiser to lock yourself in the Moomin house just to be safe.

146
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Oh dear. And I should also look after the greenhouse.

147
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:23,000
We're hoisting the sails here too, little fool!

148
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:27,000
You'll let Miss Niisku go or you'll regret that hairy bully!

149
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
No way!

150
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:32,000
I need a hostage to get out of here!

151
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Well, then you're just yourself!

152
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
What?

153
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Do you think so? Stay put, stay ahead of me, bite!

154
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Don't come here!

155
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
You can't hurt him!

156
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
He's a hostage, you know!

157
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:50,000
With his help, I can get out of these corners with my skin intact!

158
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:55,000
You better take me prisoner! It's easier to carry me!

159
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:59,000
You could be fed a fish and no one would care!

160
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:03,000
I'd be interested in its kitty litter mouth!

161
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Well, that's how it starts!

162
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,000
But stop that babbling! what is your name

163
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Little Sell!

164
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
I am captain Hudikka!

165
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Go and fetch the officials of this village villain!

166
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
And don't test my patience!

167
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:20,000
I'll go if you promise that Miss Niisku is safe!

168
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Well of course it is!

169
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:26,000
If you hurt him even a little, my revenge will be terrible!

170
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Well, it's gone!

171
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,440
Wet girl

172
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Captain Hudikka! You have been tuned!

173
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
I will release Miss Niisku immediately!

174
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
can you hear

175
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:04,680
That I would let him in there with you? I will never.

176
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:10,240
I guess I'll keep him to myself. If I get a new ship, you get her.

177
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:14,240
What do you think about it, mackerel?

178
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:19,400
Listen for a moment. Your entire crew is behind bars.

179
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:22,000
All men?

180
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:25,520
You are the last one. I'm getting into the swamp.

181
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:29,840
Thanks. I was afraid my crew was gone.

182
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:32,680
What are you thanking? They are behind bars.

183
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:36,480
Some people think they belong there, but I don't think so.

184
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:39,560
Set him free and get me a ship.

185
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:43,040
It must have two masts and fifty cannons.

186
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:46,120
No tricks or my prisoner must suffer.

187
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:48,680
You can't get enough.

188
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:53,760
There was no talk of this at the police academy. What do we do now?

189
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:57,480
You must free the swamp lady.

190
00:10:57,560 --> 00:11:00,560
He must be terribly scared.

191
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:03,640
I'm doing my best, but this is so weird.

192
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:06,720
I've never seen anything like it.

193
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:09,800
It's not Niiskunneid's fault that the pirate ship sank.

194
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:12,880
We know, we know. Oh good time.

195
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:15,960
Why did I become a police officer?

196
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:19,040
Hey, you hunsvot there.

197
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:23,120
Free the crew and get the two masts.

198
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:26,480
Listen now, Captain, times have changed.

199
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:29,560
There are no more cannons on sailing ships.

200
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:32,640
Cape echoes, how do you sink ships?

201
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:35,720
Are you trying to trick me?

202
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:38,800
Grandmama seems to have an old assault rifle.

203
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:41,880
I'm sure you'll get it, but I'm not sure if it'll work.

204
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:44,960
I warn you, its horns too.

205
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:48,040
This is my last warning, so be careful.

206
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:51,120
You have two hours to get the ship.

207
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:54,160
Set my crew free or you'll regret it.

208
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:57,240
Don't be afraid, I'm not going to hurt you.

209
00:11:57,320 --> 00:12:00,320
I just have to threaten those over there.

210
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:03,400
Otherwise I'll feed my hostage, Haile!

211
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:05,480
Ugh!

212
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:07,560
I won't do you back.

213
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:09,640
Sure, right?

214
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:12,720
Get the two-masted one if there are 50 cannons.

215
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,800
He's not feeling well.

216
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:17,880
The choice is in your hands.

217
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:19,960
Bring it to the table.

218
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:23,960
He seems serious.

219
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:27,040
Oh, we have two hours then.

220
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:29,120
My goodness.

221
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:31,200
What are you talking about?

222
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:33,280
Hi, hi, hi, hi, hi, hi!

223
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:35,360
Hi, hi, hi, hi!

224
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:37,440
I have a suggestion.

225
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:39,520
Let's climb on the roof, drill a hole.

226
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:41,600
Let's drop something on the captain.

227
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:44,680
I've always thought you don't care.

228
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:46,760
Now it has been proven.

229
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:48,840
Sorry, Chief.

230
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:52,840
What if there is a squirming hall, then they have to get out of there.

231
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:55,840
Quietly! And you can't do better.

232
00:12:56,840 --> 00:13:01,840
Doesn't help. I have to calm down now. Well, take it easy.

233
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:05,840
Captain Hodikka! Can you hear me?

234
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:08,840
Did you miss the ship so quickly?

235
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:12,840
There is no other first sailing ship in Milaakso.

236
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:15,840
A smaller yacht might do,

237
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:19,840
but I don't know if I can borrow it for this emergency.

238
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:23,840
I need a boat to live on the coast of Spain.

239
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:27,840
Calm down good man, calm down and listen.

240
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:30,840
You haven't done anything criminal here,

241
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:35,840
so if you miss that ship, we'll let you all go.

242
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:39,840
You can go wherever you want. Although on foot, but still.

243
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:44,840
Fresh air, sun, no sailing and no storms. Think about it.

244
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:48,840
We are sea scum and not vagabonds.

245
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:51,840
The Tramp's life is not funnier at all.

246
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:55,840
Behind the lonely mountains there are certainly many wealthy travelers.

247
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:58,840
There you can find gold, precious stones and...

248
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:01,840
I want a basket of the best rum, too, you fools.

249
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:03,840
Vai tollot?

250
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:06,840
Yes, planks, pines. I'm Captain Hudikka.

251
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:08,840
Now I'm getting angry.

252
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:12,840
If you were on my ship, you'd be on the hook for the money. Did you hear?

253
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:16,840
The boss loses his cool. Let's go calm down.

254
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:22,840
To whom, too. In my prison, you don't need to wait for butter on your bread.

255
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:29,840
Calm down, chief, good. Now is the best time to flaunt.

256
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:31,840
Take it easy now.

257
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:34,840
The only side dish on the bread would be mold.

258
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:37,840
The dead hour has already passed.

259
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:50,840
I warn you that you only have an hour until you can say goodbye to this child.

260
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:59,840
It's okay, little lady. I can spend.

261
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:05,840
It's okay, little lady. Hold on just a moment. We will save you.

262
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:08,840
Water, water!

263
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:10,840
What are you mumbling?

264
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:13,840
Can I have some water? Terribly thirsty.

265
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:21,840
Hello macaroni! My hostage needs a drink!

266
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:25,840
All right, bitch. I'll bring you a drink.

267
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:27,840
I can go.

268
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:31,840
Too dangerous. We take care of everything.

269
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:37,840
Just a moment. I have one suggestion that might work.

270
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:39,840
Snuffbox.

271
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:44,840
However, you should be able to handle it all on your own. Think you dare?

272
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:46,840
Of course.

273
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:55,840
What's taking so long there? You will have to wait too.

274
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:58,840
No problem. I don't mind the wait.

275
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:04,840
It's true, I'm thirsty too. Throat dries up when yelling at the police.

276
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:07,840
But don't worry, they will come soon.

277
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:11,840
Now bring that drink and fast!

278
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:14,840
Here it is, Captain.

279
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:19,840
Then don't try any tricks!

280
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:22,840
I'm not trying. I came all alone.

281
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:24,840
Are you for me too?

282
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:26,840
Yes, Captain.

283
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:30,840
Stop, and put the tray on the floor.

284
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:35,840
The bigger Mug is for the captain and the smaller one for the Niiskunneids.

285
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:38,840
Go further.

286
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:41,840
Hold on, wait there.

287
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:46,840
It's red.

288
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:51,840
Well, it's strawberry juice. It's really good.

289
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:59,840
He gets to drink from the bigger mug and I drink the other one.

290
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:03,840
There is not enough drink in the smaller mug for you.

291
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:08,840
There's no strawberry juice for a fancy drink, so I'll take that other one.

292
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:11,840
I'll take this.

293
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:15,840
No, no, swamp lady. Don't drink it.

294
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:19,840
Why not? I guess it hasn't been poisoned.

295
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:22,840
Or poisoned? Crazy idea. No, no.

296
00:17:22,840 --> 00:17:25,840
Or maybe a sleeping pill.

297
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:31,840
I thought so. I even tried two different drinks.

298
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:36,840
Run it! No, good sir. I'm not thirsty at all.

299
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:40,840
What is it? You say the drink isn't poisoned.

300
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:42,840
Juas he! I-peikk!

301
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:45,840
Or do you have a romance brewing?

302
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:51,840
A fool's errand if you ask me. One of you will drink this and drink it cool.

303
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:54,840
I drink, I drink. Give the Mug here.

304
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:58,840
Don't moan, Goblin. What if you get poisoned from it?

305
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:03,840
There's nothing dangerous about it. Don't worry at all.

306
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:05,840
They se!

307
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:11,840
Let go. Hooray, hooray!

308
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:17,840
To the last drop.

309
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:21,840
Fortunately, there was no poison in it.

310
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:23,840
Fortunately, no.

311
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:26,840
And no sleeping pills either.

312
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:29,840
Not in my case, not even that.

313
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:35,840
Moomin Goblin! Moomin Goblin!

314
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:41,840
Calm down now. Your fearful friend sleeps for a while and then wakes up.

315
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:47,840
Thought he was tricking me. Captain Hutikka, all that.

316
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:49,840
I'm very thirsty.

317
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:54,840
Good.

318
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:59,840
I'm sorry, can we get you another mug.

319
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:05,840
Let's ask without sleeping pills this time. They will surely be surprised when I don't sleep.

320
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:09,840
Awake and eyes wide open.

321
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:13,840
Let's surprise them.

322
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:27,840
Moomin Goblin!

323
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:30,840
No problem. Everything is fine.

324
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:32,840
No, not here.

325
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:34,840
No problem. Everything is fine.

326
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:37,840
There is nothing dangerous about this drink.

327
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:40,840
Oh Moomin, you...

328
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:43,840
I was pretending. Was I convincing?

329
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:45,840
Oh you!

330
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:56,840
Captain Hutikka won't wake up all day now, and not the next.

331
00:19:56,840 --> 00:20:01,840
And when he woke up his head ached excruciatingly. And that's fine.

332
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:09,840
The police chief let the pirates free before long.

333
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:15,840
You can't pirates in Moominvalley, especially without a ship.
