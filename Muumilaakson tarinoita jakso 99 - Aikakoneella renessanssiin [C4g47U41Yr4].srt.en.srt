1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Lama, lama, la-la-la-la.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Hey, I'll start looking.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Quickly hide.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Not yet, snot-nosed kid.

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
You can't come yet. And not yet.

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Let's wait.

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Striker, this way.

8
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Joo.

9
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Stay tuned. I'll try.

10
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Sell, you can't come. This is our hideout.

11
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Don't take advantage. I came to it.

12
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
So I go?

13
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Don't make a fuss about nothing.

14
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Uh, I guess we have to give up.

15
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Let's go somewhere else.

16
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Where else?

17
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
And don't give up.

18
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
What would be a good hide?

19
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Let's go there.

20
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Clear.

21
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Suddenly, suddenly. This is a good hiding place.

22
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Oh, that's right.

23
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Sell again. Go away.

24
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Come on, and now fade away.

25
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
We have to run after us all the time.

26
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:03,000
What can I do if you want to hide the same thing all the time as I do?

27
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
The sniffer will find us if we don't hide already.

28
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
True. Go elsewhere.

29
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Don't laugh what you somewhere else.

30
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
This is my and Nipsu's hiding place.

31
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Huh? Unfair.

32
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Shh, shut up. The snuff-muck can hear.

33
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Stupid. As if they want to reveal that they have gone to the basement.

34
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I suggest you find another hiding place. And suddenly.

35
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
When you recommend it.

36
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
We'll see the barrels at the gig.

37
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Varukaa.

38
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
It was on point. It was.

39
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
I was startled wildly.

40
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
What now?

41
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Help. The barrel starts the time machine.

42
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
They must be here.

43
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
I found you guys.

44
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Weird. I could have sworn I heard their voices.

45
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Hey.

46
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Where are we?

47
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
What place is this?

48
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Just some creepy place again.

49
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Juukeli, what is our home here?

50
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
It looks like some kind of machine.

51
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Can't hear. Let's go right back.

52
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Shut up you jerk. Let's find out where we are and when.

53
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,000
But we still have to be careful. Isn't that right?

54
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:57,000
After all, we have a time machine that we can use to escape if there are hot spots.

55
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Could it be that we have come to the future?

56
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
To the future?

57
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:09,000
The future may look like this. Maybe we'll start making wood again.

58
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Yes, these are indeed strange machines.

59
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Basic looking.

60
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Let's explore them a little.

61
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Hey, don't leave me here.

62
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
This looks like a studio.

63
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
I don't like those pictures.

64
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Not even an artist, because he sewed them.

65
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
A painter must like what he has painted.

66
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
What are we doing in this room?

67
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Looks like some kind of laboratory.

68
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
What is there?

69
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
The color suggests some kind of fruit juice.

70
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Fruit juice? I taste.

71
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Please don't.

72
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
I am very thirsty.

73
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
It smells awful.

74
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Do you smell it too?

75
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
I smell.

76
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
I smell.

77
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
What was it?

78
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Nipsu, you need to be more careful.

79
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
It's true, Nipsu.

80
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
What happened to your face?

81
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Just look at your own face.

82
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Trinket girl, look at yourself.

83
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
So do you.

84
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
How can beauty thrive in the midst of this mess?

85
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
What beauty are you talking about?

86
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
The one who has eyes in front of you.

87
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,000
I'm completely covered in some kind of powder.

88
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Oh my god my experiment.

89
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
It failed again.

90
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
This was already 100.8. times.

91
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Why does this always have to happen to me?

92
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Let's think that the biggest difference to these is that I constantly fail.

93
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Where the hell is wrong?

94
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Wait a minute! What's in it?

95
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Could this be it?

96
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
This is what you thought.

97
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
This might be real gold.

98
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,000
The biggest difference is Bernard de la Pinche.

99
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
You won't be digging gold now.

100
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Trinket lady, look what's in her hand.

101
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,000
That's my anklet that I just took off.

102
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Sorry good sir.

103
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Sorry, but the ring is mine.

104
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,000
who are you Where have you come from?

105
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,000
I want my gold anklet back right now.

106
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Your ankle bracelet?

107
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Ha, bailiffs. I don't understand.

108
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
What exactly is babbling?

109
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
So yes.

110
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Look at this, dear bailiffs.

111
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:42,000
The biggest difference is that Bernard de la Pinche is this rich today.

112
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Or upporikas?

113
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,000
As a great alchemist I have finally resolved,

114
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
how to turn lead into gold.

115
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
I'll pay it all back.

116
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Herrada Pinche, we are not bailiffs.

117
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
You are not bailiffs.

118
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:02,000
It then means that you are tax bears.

119
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
It went wrong again.

120
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
What, don't you?

121
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Only then I know. I know, I know, I know.

122
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:13,000
You have come to learn from Bernard de la Pinche, so...

123
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Wrong.

124
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Oh, for what the hell.

125
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
We have tried to explain,

126
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,000
you don't have that kind of thing back for you.

127
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
What? Oh, what object?

128
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
My anklet.

129
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,000
I took it out and put it on that table a moment ago.

130
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:33,000
In that case, the gold didn't come from my experiment either.

131
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Well, not really.

132
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Gold has never been born from the juice of any Korean-colored fruit.

133
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,000
I, the unfortunate one, failed again.

134
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Don't go any further.

135
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,000
It is impossible to make gold from any other substance.

136
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Thank you for those words.

137
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Even geniuses needed comforting, although you are completely wrong.

138
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,000
By the way, who are you and where do you come from?

139
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Hey!

140
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,000
He could have left me a little piece.

141
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Stuck everything on his cheek.

142
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,000
How would you have been hungry for a long time.

143
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Yes, Master Pinci is a painter.

144
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,000
But lately he has been experimenting.

145
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
And there hasn't been enough money for food.

146
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,000
And no one seems to be buying his paintings either.

147
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Absolutely.

148
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
He calls himself a great genius.

149
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
But frankly, he's plain.

150
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
He's a genius.

151
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,000
The master is a great genius.

152
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Great that you are defending your champion, but start looking at a new job.

153
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,000
My master is not bad-mouthed.

154
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
I can understand your feelings.

155
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Believe it anyway.

156
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,000
The name of this painting is Mona Lisa.

157
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,000
And the duke has ordered it from the master.

158
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Hey, the painting is really mediocre.

159
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Not from much of anything.

160
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,000
The Master started it fifteen years ago.

161
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
So long ago.

162
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Hey, what does that guy think he's doing?

163
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Hoi, black!

164
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Genius, stop cooking already and finish painting your board.

165
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Dude, it's too late now.

166
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
How come?

167
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:36,000
In the meantime, the Duchess has grown old.

168
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Not even a genius can paint him from memory.

169
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:46,000
There is always another model. Some young and beautiful girl.

170
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Even hotter, I could use someone as a model.

171
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Here would be one with a Turkish.

172
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Where?

173
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Right in front of your eyes.

174
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Kaskunen didn't immediately catch my eye.

175
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
So yes.

176
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:08,000
The excellent model Mona Lisa is completed in that place.

177
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
This is a great honor.

178
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,000
You look exactly like a young Mona Lisa.

179
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:18,000
That man does not recognize true beauty, even though he is an artist.

180
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Not going to be famous.

181
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Good without moving. This puts me in a good mood.

182
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Delightful. You are a great model.

183
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Could you smile a little just like that?

184
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Good.

185
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:48,000
A work of art that will live forever is getting ready.

186
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Oh no. Smile, smile, smile.

187
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Well, now the master continues his work.

188
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Hustling like crazy. That's good.

189
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Oh this joy. It's the first time I see a master painting so happy.

190
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,000
That's more fun than messing around.

191
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:13,000
No more finishing touches like this.

192
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Is the painting finished now?

193
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Can't move.

194
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:43,000
I have just finished the finest work of art of the century.

195
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
I wouldn't have been able to do this without her.

196
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
I would very much like to see the painting.

197
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Oh luckily, let there be only a champion.

198
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Will you bring the old lady?

199
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Nothing. The appearance of one.

200
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,000
I want to see too. Shall I?

201
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
It doesn't remind me at all.

202
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Not so. Niskunneiti looks quite different.

203
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
So about the face.

204
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:10,000
But I didn't mean to paint the face of the little girl.

205
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
But only his soul.

206
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Ai.

207
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Oh, I didn't know there was a soul before.

208
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Hey, let's go back to Moominvalley.

209
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,000
I can't bear to watch this shit anymore.

210
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Good lady. You may only see ruins.

211
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:35,000
But these widgets are the great inventions of a master.

212
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Is this some kind of invention?

213
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:42,000
But what the heck is in the office?

214
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,000
I have to admit it's not finished yet.

215
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:49,000
I think that inventions must be ready.

216
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Why don't we go home?

217
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:58,000
This is the machine with which you can travel from time to time.

218
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
So. My father built it.

219
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Right. Then your father is also a great genius.

220
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,000
There is. Planning took ages.

221
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:10,000
For once your speech makes some sense.

222
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Don't now.

223
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Tell me why there is a clock face here?

224
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
It must not be removed.

225
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
You can't take it as a joke. Time to machine.

226
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,000
What if it breaks? What about us then?

227
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Don't panic. Trust me. I'll separate it.

228
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Now we might not make it back.

229
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Hey master is going to break the time machine.

230
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,000
The keys separated it from the trick.

231
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Oh horrible.

232
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Oh, are you okay?

233
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Was the master hurt badly?

234
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
What happened here?

235
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:52,000
It was an electric shock. The master was electrocuted.

236
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:58,000
I see. Or electricity. Electricity is produced with the help of a magnet.

237
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Absolutely. If I use electricity, I can complete all my inventions.

238
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:08,000
I see. Here is the current approach and this turn should be connected to that pole.

239
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:12,000
This trick will eliminate all transmission problems.

240
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,000
And so I am on top of science.

241
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Oh, the time machine seems to be from the past.

242
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:22,000
I don't understand anything he says.

243
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:27,000
This is the right part. Sorry. Could you borrow this for a moment?

244
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
What is it?

245
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:34,000
It looks like a huge bathtub.

246
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:38,000
It is for automotive, land, sea and air use.

247
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Oh, nothing.

248
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:45,000
We want the time machine back to the way it was.

249
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Yes, I know.

250
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Oh, we trust him.

251
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:54,000
You have nothing to worry about, I'll fix the time machine even better.

252
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Hmph!

253
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
What was it?

254
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
What exactly happened?

255
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
It's a burglar alarm.

256
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Then you have thieves.

257
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
I'll go check.

258
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
It scares me terribly.

259
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
That's where those thieves are.

260
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,000
They visited the master's recent work.

261
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Monoalisan vai?

262
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
That they dare.

263
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
The board must be recovered.

264
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Not waiting.

265
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Master, I'm going out for a moment.

266
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
What has happened?

267
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Oh what happened.

268
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Someone just stole the painting the master was so proud of.

269
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
Proud?

270
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:56,000
A master should not play in bathtubs. Did you hear?

271
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,000
My board was taken.

272
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
The curse of genius.

273
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,000
The thief is some jealous painter.

274
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Listen master, something has to be done and quickly.

275
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Don't jump.

276
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:14,000
This is the most welcome opportunity to chase thieves and test my car at the same time.

277
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Don't stand there like a log.

278
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Hop on board.

279
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Does the tub even move?

280
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Well, I'll tell you.

281
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Maybe not anyway.

282
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
It works!

283
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:37,000
Help! Just jump in the tub! Help! Can you hear that?

284
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
Help! Help! Help!

285
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:45,000
This is fun. I drive the world to hell.

286
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:48,000
A brisk ride could be fun.

287
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,000
But weren't we supposed to catch the board thieves?

288
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:55,000
You are right. I really wanted to come here.

289
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:09,000
Well done boy. I'll take the reins now.

290
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,000
Tartu kepälän!

291
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
Ven champion!

292
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Six! Six!

293
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
The thieves turned to the alley!

294
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
So they turned. I saw.

295
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Well, the cancellation was successful.

296
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,000
That's where the thieves are.

297
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Speed up!

298
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Let's catch up!

299
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,000
What?

300
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
Get the rag off your face and quickly!

301
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
The river is ahead!

302
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
The river is ahead!

303
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
The river is ahead!

304
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Short!

305
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,000
The river is ahead!

306
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000
Six!

307
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
Look what's down there!

308
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Wise thieves planned everything in advance.

309
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
We almost caught them.

310
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,000
We'll get them!

311
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Don't be sad! This situation is no problem for Bernaduda pintz.

312
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,000
Look!

313
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,000
Shall we go in the water?

314
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,000
Stop! I don't like the river and I don't like water in general!

315
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
Crazy!

316
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
Moomin!

317
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
What if this went wrong?

318
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,000
Go now!

319
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,000
A Moomin would laugh at that blue obscenity.

320
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
Is this it?

321
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
Very inspiring!

322
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,000
The vest is the biggest difference!

323
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,000
Now you see my invention in the right light!

324
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
Crazy!

325
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
Where are the thieves headed now?

326
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,000
Pick up the pace!

327
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,000
Trying to escape. Now seems to be the right time.

328
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,000
Suitable for what?

329
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:52,000
Moomipeiko won't you pull the red vivo now?

330
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
Clear! From red!

331
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
Pick up the pace!

332
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
Hey look!

333
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:34,000
Bernarduna Pinchi did what I expected.

334
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
Flying in the air is fun!

335
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
I feel like a bird.

336
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:42,000
Let's hope the cart doesn't break when we land!

337
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,000
I have painted the most beautiful picture in the world,

338
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:48,000
built the world's first land in water

339
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
and airborne.

340
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:54,000
I have painted the world's first on land in water

341
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,000
and a means of transportation moving in the air and thanks to you.

342
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
It was just a pleasure to be of help,

343
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:02,000
but the master will fix the time machine.

344
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
That we can get home again?

345
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,000
What? What the hell time machine?

346
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
Don't pretend!

347
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
No, I'm faking it!

348
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:14,000
You can stay as my apprentice!

349
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,000
Where have they gone to hide?

350
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:26,000
Now I'm going to look for it.

351
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
Hey, we're home!

352
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
What is hiding?

353
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
I found you all.

354
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
Hello, Snuska-muikkunne!

355
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
How did you find that?

356
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:43,000
Don't you remember, we play hide and seek, do you get bored?

357
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:47,000
Well, it was, and we had to go into hiding.

358
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:50,000
I had forgotten it all along!

359
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:58,000
I must admit that Bernardo da Pinci was no mean talker.

360
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:02,000
He even knew how to fix his father's time machine and just playing.

361
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,000
Such was the great genius.

362
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
What makes you laugh so much?

363
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:12,000
Now I imagine myself in the world's most famous painting.

364
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
