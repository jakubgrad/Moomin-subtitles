1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
The rain has once again spoiled Moominvalley.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Now it hasn't rained to the point of flooding, but everyone is in a particularly good mood when the rain finally subsides and the sun comes out.

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:39,000
That someone could be that stupid.

4
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
How so?

5
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Look at the Moomins and the scumbags and they should be rational beings.

6
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Love, fools.

7
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Joo.

8
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
One day you will fall in love too.

9
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Not soon, it's not easy to find a suitable destination.

10
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,000
What? Are you interested in shock or inventions and Hemuli is just too old.

11
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,000
The chief of police would act, but he's in a tizzy.

12
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Nuskamuikko doesn't think too much of it, but he doesn't agree.

13
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
There are none other than...

14
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Cry?

15
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
A less glamorous type.

16
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
What do you mean?

17
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I can't stand being cheated, but I want a lot of presents.

18
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Gifts?

19
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:27,000
I don't start courting anyone, and I don't give anyone flowers or boxes of chocolates.

20
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
I popped the chocolates myself.

21
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Yes, of course.

22
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Mmm, yummy. Well, I'm leaving.

23
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Ai, minne?

24
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
How about tell me?

25
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Aha, somewhere where there is gold.

26
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
How did you know?

27
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Otherwise, you wouldn't give up the meal break.

28
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Sell, promise you won't cheat on a single soul.

29
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Gold can still be washed upriver to the north.

30
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
That's the end of it.

31
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Thank God.

32
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
You don't understand how gold goes into the blood.

33
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Where did the snap go?

34
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Away to forget your love for me.

35
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Crazy idea, to get a swing for Luojaparatko.

36
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Oops, looks like it's going to rain.

37
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Best not to rush.

38
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Should have asked for more detailed instructions.

39
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Oh!

40
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Wake up!

41
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Oh, what a thick fog.

42
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
No more river.

43
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
I have to turn home.

44
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
But where is home?

45
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Hi, is anyone there?

46
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Hoi!

47
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
I should have taken Myy on the trip.

48
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
He has never been lost.

49
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Haa!

50
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
I should have taken Myy on the trip.

51
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
He has never been lost.

52
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Haa!

53
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Haa!

54
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
This!

55
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
This!

56
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
This!

57
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
This!

58
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Hi, hi, hi...

59
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:37,260
Well?

60
00:03:37,660 --> 00:03:38,160
Hm?

61
00:03:38,660 --> 00:03:39,560
Hm?

62
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:53,920
Hm!

63
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:54,540
Hm!

64
00:03:54,620 --> 00:03:55,120
Hm!

65
00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:55,760
Hm!

66
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:56,380
Hm!

67
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:57,020
Hm!

68
00:03:57,100 --> 00:03:57,600
Hm!

69
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:58,180
Hm!

70
00:03:58,320 --> 00:03:58,820
Hm!

71
00:03:58,900 --> 00:03:59,440
are you sick?

72
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:00,200
Hm?

73
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:01,380
Hm!

74
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:02,620
H?

75
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,320
Treatment!

76
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:03,400
Anyone here?

77
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Help! Help!

78
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Lovely girl.

79
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Did you find it honey?

80
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Eyelash, I'm talking to you.

81
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Ami.

82
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Can't you hear?

83
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Leave me alone.

84
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Morning.

85
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Good morning, Nipsu.

86
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:29,000
From that day on, every morning Nipsu went to the mountains to the edge of the stream.

87
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
What the hell has happened to Nipsu?

88
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Emuli said that Nipsu always leaves somewhere in the morning and doesn't come back until late.

89
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Every day last week too.

90
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:44,000
So. What secrets does Nipsu have in the mountains?

91
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,000
What the hell does Nipsu have in the mountains?

92
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Antulee.

93
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
It's getting foggy.

94
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,000
What? Did Moomin go after Nipsu?

95
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Yep, he's going to find out why Nipsu disappears somewhere in the mornings.

96
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Muimetta! Minuhan se piti vakoilla Nipsua.

97
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,000
We can trust Moomin's abilities.

98
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
He will come!

99
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Moomin, you came and...

100
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Well, tell me! What does Nipsu do all day?

101
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Well, at least it doesn't bring gold.

102
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Moomin!

103
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Moomin!

104
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Myi and Miss Niisku.

105
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Sorry, I can't say anything now.

106
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
I want to be alone.

107
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:26,000
And you said we could trust Moomin's abilities.

108
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
That's what I said.

109
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Well, what?

110
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
I want to be alone.

111
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
And doesn't eat anything.

112
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
No, just like Nipsu.

113
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Concern.

114
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
No, no, no.

115
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
No, just like Nipsu.

116
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Worrying.

117
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,000
What strange thing has happened to them in the mountains?

118
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
I'll go find out about it.

119
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,000
You don't. Way too stalky for you.

120
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
What do you mean?

121
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
It's easy to get lost in the mountains.

122
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:11,000
And since you don't know what has happened there, you have to be careful.

123
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:15,000
The task requires experience, courage and skill.

124
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Well, who would have that?

125
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
I'll get to it.

126
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Don't be sad. Everything is going well.

127
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Remember to be careful.

128
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Good morning!

129
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Why are you on the move?

130
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
I'm not.

131
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Now it is.

132
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
I am.

133
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
I am.

134
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
I am.

135
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
I am.

136
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
I am.

137
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
I am.

138
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
I am.

139
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,500
Why are you up so early?

140
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:21,000
I don't have time to talk now, I'm shadowing them.

141
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Or you work as an undercover cop, why?

142
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Something serious is going on.

143
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Well, what a good habit you brought!

144
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
What a trouble!

145
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
And the rest we do too.

146
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Moominpapa is also infected.

147
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Even so, he immediately shut himself in the room.

148
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:04,000
He shouldn't have been in the room.

149
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Moomin, Moomin, Moomin, Moomin.

150
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Moomin, Moomin, Moomin, Moomin!

151
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Moomin, Moomin, Moomin, Moomin!

152
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Moomin, Moomin, Moomin!

153
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,000
He shouldn't have let me in on it.

154
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Oh, wait for the salt?

155
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Give me some salt!

156
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Pardon? What did you say?

157
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Could you pass the salt?

158
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
That's enough for me.

159
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
How about dessert?

160
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
I can't take it anymore either.

161
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,000
I'm going to find out what's behind this!

162
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Me too. Mamma, join us.

163
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Yeah, I don't know. They are such changelings that maybe we shouldn't get involved.

164
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Well, but the rest of the mipekko didn't take dessert seriously.

165
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Hmm, true.

166
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Hi, where are you going?

167
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
To the secret place to the north.

168
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
There too?

169
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Can I come along?

170
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Oh, you too.

171
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Yeah, I've been working on this. What exactly is the matter?

172
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Seems serious.

173
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Hmm, they come back like a charm. Something inexplicable is happening there.

174
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
That along the river facing north, right?

175
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Hmm.

176
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Yeah, right.

177
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Do you know anything about it?

178
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Hardly, but don't be sad Moomin mom.

179
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Yes, that fever will gradually pass.

180
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
The fog is rising!

181
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
I can't see anything.

182
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Hey, wait for me!

183
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
I can walk.

184
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
I can't hear the sound of the water.

185
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Oh, we're lost.

186
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Hemuli, where are you going?

187
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Something says this way.

188
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Lightning!

189
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
There they are!

190
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Oh, my brother is there too.

191
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
What are they staring at?

192
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Good unusual.

193
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
What do you see?

194
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Now tell me what you see!

195
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Quietly!

196
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Waters.

197
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Waters?

198
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Oh, how beautiful.

199
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Where did they hide?

200
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Psst, sell, come here.

201
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
I don't see anything watery.

202
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
What exactly is the matter?

203
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:40,000
The water went away, because the little ones lived.

204
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Tomorrow then.

205
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
He will come back.

206
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Moomin troll.

207
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:55,000
The news of a lovely mermaid spread to Moomin Valley.

208
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:02,000
The mermaid has put the women of Moomin Valley in a crisis.

209
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Only men are capable of seeing things that do not exist.

210
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Ladies of Moominvalley, how do we drive this madness away?

211
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Men need to be taught this.

212
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
There's only one way.

213
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
And what is it?

214
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:21,000
The mermaid lives in Lammiko and Lammiko must be got rid of.

215
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:25,000
He likes Lamme, even though he doesn't exist.

216
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Did you come up with something better?

217
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
If you still wait.

218
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:33,000
We women have been trampled on enough.

219
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
The suggestion is good.

220
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Let's go fill up the Pond.

221
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Tomorrow we'll set out with hoeing jalapeños.

222
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Lammikko and Lammikko

223
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Good morning

224
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
Lammikko and Lammikko

225
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Good morning

226
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
The pond has dried up.

227
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
Lammikko and Lammikko

228
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:22,300
People

229
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:35,000
Men have more imagination. I've always known that.

230
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:39,000
Wouldn't it be best to forget the water ones?

231
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:43,000
It wasn't more beautiful than mymmeli.

232
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:49,000
Uhu, is this the pond?

233
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
Where has the water evaporated?

234
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
The rain has washed the pond away.

235
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:58,000
Myo, Is this what you meant?

236
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Good morning ladies.

237
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,000
Where is the trip? New gold rush huh?

238
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:06,000
We came to fill this pond.

239
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,000
Really, you ladies?

240
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
What do you tolerate laughing at?

241
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:21,000
Sorry, but when I see in my mind how you fill the pond with shovels and hoes.

242
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,000
Are you healthy yet?

243
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
Don't screw up.

244
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
Oh, you're Mrs. Yourself again.

245
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:32,000
I've left you alone for days.

246
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:35,000
Well, it's okay, I'll have time to clean up.

247
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,000
Mimmel?

248
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,000
I'm hungry, let's go home.

249
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
I have too.

250
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:56,000
The bone-chilling fever passed.

251
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:02,000
It is said that at this time of the year you can sometimes see mermaids in small mountain ponds.

252
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
I wouldn't have believed it.

253
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,000
I didn't see the mermaid!

254
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:10,000
I think only men see that delusion.

255
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:15,000
Love is boring, but someone falls in love with an illusion attack!

256
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:18,000
Come on, I think I'm going to push the envelope.

257
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:27,000
No one knew where the mermaid disappeared to or if she even existed.

258
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
Maybe that's a good thing.
