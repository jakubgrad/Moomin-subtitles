1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
One summer day Moominpa got a bad cold.

2
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Papa, I brought you hot milk. how are you now

3
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Poorly.

4
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
At least the fever is gone.

5
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
If the onion milk is as long as it is hot.

6
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I'll try.

7
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Listen mom, I've been thinking about it all pretty much.

8
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
I see. What have you been thinking about?

9
00:00:53,000 --> 00:01:02,000
If I wasn't alive, you and Moomin wouldn't know a damn thing about the wild adventures of my youth.

10
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Oh, I thought you were just talking about them in your memoirs.

11
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:14,000
No, no, they only start from the moment I met you. I alone know about the earlier stages.

12
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Why didn't you start with the first steps of your life, the way memoirs are usually started?

13
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Although it's nice to start with me.

14
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:29,000
I had my weaknesses, my youth was apparently stormy.

15
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Ipsu will open, I have news.

16
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Hello to me.

17
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Huumi pappa is dead in his tracks.

18
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
If you come right away, you'll get a fairy-tale wide from him. In a hurry.

19
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Alright please.

20
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Muaska muikkent.

21
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Hello my, how is Moomin papa?

22
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Just fine.

23
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Nice to hear.

24
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Yeah, but he's mad at you for not coming to see him.

25
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Do not.

26
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
You must come right now.

27
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
The little salesman said that you will give me a fairy-tale gift.

28
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
And that you're mad at me.

29
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Sell, I just told you to ask them here.

30
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
I made sure they came too.

31
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,000
You know Papa Moomin, when he gets sick, he takes it so seriously.

32
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Well, now he wants to tell you about his youth.

33
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Cool stuff, I've always been interested in that.

34
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
As a child, I looked just like Moomin the troll.

35
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:44,000
And strangely enough, I had friends who resembled snuff and snuff.

36
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Did you meet anyone who looks like me?

37
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
I met

38
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
A beauty without bangs.

39
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:57,000
One stormy and disconsolate August night.

40
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:03,000
A package made of an old paper bag was left on the steps of the Löytö children's home.

41
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,000
We even dare to throw trash on our steps.

42
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:24,000
The cart was noticed by the director of the children's home, who looked a lot like Vili jonkka.

43
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Oh, abandoned child.

44
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
It was me, you.

45
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Were you rejected?

46
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Oh, oh, this is going to be difficult for a child.

47
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
I don't want to be number 13.

48
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:55,000
There are 12 finders before you. I don't like number 13 myself.

49
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Hey, you've wet your bed.

50
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
I dreamed that I was sitting on a potty.

51
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
You are twice as hard as others.

52
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:24,000
I think it's unfair that exactly that dream was completely true when I left.

53
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Life is unfair.

54
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Well, when you greet me, you hold him here at a 45 degree angle.

55
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Did you understand?

56
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,000
That's a 90 degree angle.

57
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Doesn't Tadd think it should be?

58
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Must not. For the reason that I have decided that the angle should be 45 degrees.

59
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:56,000
The head of the foundlings' home didn't tolerate being bullied against him.

60
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:01,000
After a few years, you won't get a degree angle.

61
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Heaven, that's me.

62
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Unbelievable. I have seeds, canes, ears.

63
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
I'm nice and round.

64
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
I have other things with me.

65
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
I have everything with me.

66
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
I have everything with me.

67
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
I have everything with me.

68
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
I have everything with me.

69
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Nice upright ears.

70
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:35,000
I'm nice and round. No disgusting corners or lumps at all.

71
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,000
I look really cute in every way.

72
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Only my slightly short legs break the perfection.

73
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:46,000
But they grow if I walk and run a lot.

74
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Oh!

75
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:02,000
So I was lashed to my first skirmish and to the maple of death.

76
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,000
I was saved.

77
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,000
And that's when I made my decision.

78
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:33,000
I'm not going to live a safe, stagnant life. I create my own happiness.

79
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:42,000
The best, Auntie. Big tasks await me.

80
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Life is short. I'm leaving. Don't mourn.

81
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Postscript. I took a can of pumpkin jam with me. Munipeikko.

82
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Maybe I should have left during the day.

83
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:18,000
If I close my eyes, I have nothing to fear.

84
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:46,000
I should have left for the day.

85
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Hey!

86
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Ouch!

87
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Amu!

88
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Who made that watermill? It's beautiful.

89
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,000
I have done it.

90
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Ai!

91
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Hey!

92
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Hey!

93
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Big tasks.

94
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
I have done.

95
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
I have done.

96
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Hey!

97
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Hey!

98
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
I'm taking an important exam.

99
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Oh, try?

100
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,000
So, I studied how the new ship's propeller spins.

101
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Oh, the propeller! Do you have just the right ship?

102
00:09:53,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Yes, I just finished it. It is being painted now and next it will be ceremonially launched.

103
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Oh, that sounds amazing.

104
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Well, do you want to see the ship?

105
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Sure, I'd love to, where is it?

106
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
This way.

107
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Oh yeah, I'm Fredrickson, what about you?

108
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Moomi.

109
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:21,000
That's the name I was called before Moomin came into the world.

110
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
That's it.

111
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Tremendous. It sure is fun to build your own ship.

112
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:35,000
It is, it is. You have to stay and watch the landing.

113
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Oh, with joy. Stay as long as you want.

114
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
That's what I like.

115
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,000
So has Hosuli faded away?

116
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,000
I asked him to paint the ship.

117
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Was it to make him lazy?

118
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Hi Hosuli!

119
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,000
I'm here, Fredrickson.

120
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:04,000
I was looking for red paint.

121
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:08,000
My new friend Moomipeikko participates in the descent into the water.

122
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Please paint faster.

123
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
This here is Hosuli.

124
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
How do you do.

125
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Hey, same words. Don't worry, I'll paint as fast as I can.

126
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Hosuli didn't look exactly like Nipsu, but otherwise resembled him.

127
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:30,000
This is the command bridge. The ship is steered from here.

128
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
There's someone there.

129
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Ahaa, himself on Juxu.

130
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:39,000
And you didn't notice that the door said no entry?

131
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:42,000
I don't believe in bans.

132
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:48,000
He was just like you, Nuuska Muikkunen. Quite obvious.

133
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,000
What is the name of the ship?

134
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Meren huiske.

135
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,000
So does it wheeze when it sails?

136
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Of course not. The name tries to be poetic.

137
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:05,000
I first thought of Siiri or Helena, but this seemed better.

138
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:09,000
How the hell did you manage to get the ship moved to the river?

139
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:13,000
The monstrosity, we haven't thought of that. What do we do?

140
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:17,000
I'll just paint now, I'll know soon enough.

141
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Did you come up with a solution, Fredrickson?

142
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,000
I'm asking Drontti Edward for help.

143
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Drontti is apparently taking a nap further down the river.

144
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,000
It's so big you can't help but notice it.

145
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Is Drontti dangerous?

146
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Not at all, but I'm careful not to accidentally step on you.

147
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Fredrickson are you serious?

148
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:48,000
I am, I am. Drontti always pays the funeral expenses.

149
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Hey, Edward, can you hear me? Fredrickson is here. are you there

150
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Aha, there it is.

151
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:04,000
I would like to ask a favor, okay?

152
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Couldn't you bathe in the river today, just for a change?

153
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:17,000
The water in the river is sweetly warm and the bottom is fine fine sand.

154
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Now it stood up.

155
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Now it stood up.

156
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Let's start the waterlily ceremonies.

157
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Let's hurry to the ship!

158
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Anchors up, close hatches.

159
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:27,000
The water is rising, everyone in their places, watch out for the waves.

160
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Start the machines!

161
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:43,000
Succeeded! The water bill was successful!

162
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Drontti is staring at us, Fredrickson.

163
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,000
How do we get past the drone?

164
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,000
We were sailing on a collision course.

165
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
There's no way around this.

166
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,000
What can be seen behind the drone?

167
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Real sea, ocean and exciting adventures, who knew.

168
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Yeah, adventures.

169
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:15,000
It would be incredibly kind of you to let us sail past.

170
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:18,000
It doesn't cost you anything.

171
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Wouldn't you like to move your little stern?

172
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,000
It's too late now.

173
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Moomin, I think this could be classified as an adventure.

174
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Hi! Hi! Hi!

175
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Back! God!

176
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:58,000
That sounded like a hosul's voice.

177
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:02,000
What's on his mind now?

178
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Hi! Stay in our jar, we'll get you.

179
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:12,000
Ilkimys, you launched, even though I was still painting.

180
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Yeah, yeah!

181
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Sorry, I'll throw the rope.

182
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Wake up!

183
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Wake up!

184
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Wake up!

185
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Hurrah! We got past the ront!

186
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Hurrah!

187
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Long live, sea spray!

188
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
Hooray!

189
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Long live, sea spray! Hooray! Hooray!

190
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
No, who is it?

191
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
Bogey.

192
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Who is that moron?

193
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,000
It will alarm someone.

194
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
What will it do if it catches on?

195
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:38,000
It's not doing anything, it's just lonely.

196
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:43,000
But if it manages to touch you, you will be left in a mess.

197
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:47,000
It's too late to go help now.

198
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
Hi! Moomin! What are you trying?

199
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Don't ask fools, I'm going to save the drowning.

200
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,000
Don't get stuck now if you go too close to the swamp.

201
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
I can't watch edited.

202
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Besides, this is an adventure.

203
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
Go away, don't come any closer.

204
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,000
When it's freezing, it's freezing.

205
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:14,000
I turn to ice. Help!

206
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,000
Hi, saving Moomin here.

207
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:20,000
Oh, I'm freezing. Help, help!

208
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Hey, jump into the canning jar.

209
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Wake up!

210
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
Wake up!

211
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,000
It was my third adventure.

212
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:42,000
And at the same time, the first time I saved someone's life.

213
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:46,000
It was wonderful! I want to become an adventurer too.

214
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,000
Who was that woman you saved?

215
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
And how did he do?

216
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:54,000
Well, that's another story.

217
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,000
I really like those other stories.

218
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
Who was that woman?

219
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
Director of the children's home.

220
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,000
Was it?

221
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:06,000
Yeah, he was obviously looking for me.

222
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
Yes, number 13.

223
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Pass the horror. If I had known, I wouldn't have meant...

224
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:18,000
Well, what's done is done. You acted bravely.

225
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,000
No one asked for an opinion there.

226
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:25,000
Tell me, Moomin, who are these forest people?

227
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:28,000
They are my friends.

228
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:32,000
I take care of them and teach them a thing or two.

229
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:36,000
I just remembered I have work to do downstairs.

230
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,000
Me too.

231
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:41,000
Hey, stop! Don't go anywhere. Did you hear?

232
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
Discipline is everything.

233
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:48,000
Place yourself in order of the length of the queue right away.

234
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:52,000
I understand why papa skipped that episode too...

235
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:56,000
Too bad you didn't know aunt before you rushed to help.

236
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:03,000
Yes, but I would have saved him anyway in accordance with my heroic nature.

237
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:06,000
How was your childhood?

238
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:12,000
Of course not. Don't be sad, mom, or the orphanage phase was dark.

239
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:16,000
But the next period of my youth was exciting.

240
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:20,000
But I'll tell you about that and the headmistress of the children's home later.

241
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:29,000
Like all good story tellers, Moominpappa knew how to end his story at the right place.
