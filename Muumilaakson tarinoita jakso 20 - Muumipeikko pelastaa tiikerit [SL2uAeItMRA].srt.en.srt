1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Moomin, where are you? Wet lady.

2
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:22,000
A rhinoceros and two tigers now live in the forest surrounding the Moomin house.

3
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
The skunk has set them free from the zoo.

4
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Have you seen Moomin?

5
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
I won't be all evening.

6
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
I couldn't go.

7
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Meanwhile, Moomin and Miss Niisku desperately swim to escape the snake.

8
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I can't even sleep anymore.

9
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
You must.

10
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Hi! Hi!

11
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Hmm.

12
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I can take a little longer.

13
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,000
A couple of hippopotamuses are heading this way. Gotta get them on board.

14
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,000
The zoo did not announce that the hippos were also missing.

15
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,000
The last coating Niisku neiti.

16
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Ehdimäpäs

17
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Agile as hippos.

18
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Thank you very much. A huge beast was chasing us.

19
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Do hornets eat hippos?

20
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Thank you for saving our lives.

21
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
We are from the zoo.

22
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,000
From the zoo? Have you caught a crocodile?

23
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
And it was a tricky case, that's what I'm saying.

24
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Another crocodile swims in these waters.

25
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:55,000
I know. I wish crocodiles were as easy to catch as you hippopotamuses.

26
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
A power horse?

27
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
A power horse?

28
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Which zoo are you from? You must be needed.

29
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
I'm a Moomin, not a hippopotamus.

30
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Do I look like a hippopotamus?

31
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Racial purity may not be perfect.

32
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:15,000
It's not, but they look quite enough like hippos.

33
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Can't tell the difference between a hippopotamus and a Moomin, even if you work in a zoo?

34
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,000
I'm not considered a hippopotamus, it's too thick.

35
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Niskuneiti, let's get under our feet.

36
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Stop, stop, we have a suitable cage ready for you.

37
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Hurry up, little lady!

38
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Don't let them run away, men, catch the hippos!

39
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Moomin, Pekka, me, shall we go?

40
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
To the sea!

41
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Rescue, boat, quick!

42
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
We don't go to any zoo.

43
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
What made you come back so suddenly?

44
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Come on!

45
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Don't worry, I never eat while swimming.

46
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Are you sure?

47
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Oh, there's a boat coming.

48
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:09,000
They are bad men, they are going to send us to the zoo.

49
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Probably me too.

50
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
They have already caught the crocodile.

51
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
At least I'm not going back to the zoo.

52
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Jump on my back and we'll disappear.

53
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Paho!

54
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Stay tuned!

55
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Come back, disgusting reptile!

56
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Will Moomin, Pekka, get into trouble?

57
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Not alone, Niskunnetti also had to.

58
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Oh, oh, it can't be true.

59
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
I almost never lie.

60
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
It's a sad story, but it was still worth telling.

61
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Moomin Laakso didn't have the same tricks.

62
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
And not a single tiger, eh?

63
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
You brought the blade here.

64
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Still, not that I would believe Haisuli's words.

65
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:03,000
But let's go find the children anyway, papa.

66
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Well, at least I was told, my conscience is a mess now.

67
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Where did the skunk attack them?

68
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
With a marsh that is taken to the sea.

69
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Mom on the way.

70
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
I'll come along.

71
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:21,000
No, you stay here and tell Moomin Peiko that we're looking for him in case he comes back.

72
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
And you get to be our guide, Stink.

73
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Aha!

74
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Will come.

75
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Have you poked the Moomin Fairy and the Snow Maiden on your cheek?

76
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Mom, we're home.

77
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Moomin and Snow Maiden.

78
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Our new friend.

79
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,000
He's big. Go in as much as you want.

80
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Haisuli just said that the kärme had eaten his plastic trolls, the hit girl.

81
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Stink, where did you hurry?

82
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:06,000
To tell you the truth, we were chased by the skunk, but then the men started scaring the skunk too.

83
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:11,000
We escaped on the back of the spear. And now there is our good friend.

84
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Who were those men?

85
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Zoo men. They try to catch the animals and then take them back to the zoo.

86
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,000
And I don't want to go to the zoo anymore.

87
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Father is protected our friends.

88
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
To the last scale.

89
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,000
I'm sure the rhinos don't want the tigers back either.

90
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Of course not, now that they get to live in our nice jungle.

91
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Go take a look around. You will definitely feel at home in our jungle.

92
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Come back if you see the men from the zoo.

93
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Thanks, good suggestion.

94
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
I'm going to show you the jungle.

95
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Oh, I'm glad you came back safe and sound.

96
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Yes, but I didn't have time to tell everything yet.

97
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:03,000
So? Can you imagine, we were mistaken for hippos.

98
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,000
What? Who would dare to think so?

99
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Well, those zoo men. They thought we had escaped from the cage and tried to capture us.

100
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:18,000
The height of rudeness. We Moomins are completely different from hippos.

101
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:25,000
So the zoo men are trying to cage not only all our wild animal guests, but also us.

102
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
So?

103
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Hippos don't wear aprons or write memoirs.

104
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Those men haven't faced Moominpapa's wrath yet.

105
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:41,000
I'd like to see how you disciplined me.

106
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Maybe one of the tigers.

107
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Not willingly. We became friends at the zoo.

108
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Choke the skunk. That would be fortunate for everyone.

109
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Possibly, but he set us free from the zoo.

110
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:05,000
I'm really disappointed. I thought you would have been chasing pooches, but you went to the hay to visit.

111
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Nothing is possible. We've always lived in a zoo, and we haven't hunted in the jungle on a moon day.

112
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000
So what kind of food do you eat?

113
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Share, cat food.

114
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Oh, now. Unheard of before.

115
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Cat food makes our fur shiny.

116
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Our biggest treat is the jars with the black myrrh picture, isn't it?

117
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Yes it is. Do you happen to have cat food?

118
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Yes.

119
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Dad, now those men from the zoo are here!

120
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Dad, what are we doing?

121
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Now let's take the animals in first. Hurry up, Moomin Goblin.

122
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Clear.

123
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,000
The zoo men have come to capture you.

124
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Run inside quickly.

125
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,000
The main road to the Moomin house.

126
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Puck, puck!

127
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Yes, I will.

128
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Thanks.

129
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Well, is the oven a good hiding place?

130
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Nothing seems to come of your hiding.

131
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,000
How so? He doesn't notice me at all.

132
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,000
I lie here and present a porcelain ornament.

133
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
No one is going to beat me to it.

134
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Can you guess that there is a rhinoceros under the table?

135
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Thank you, Moomin-Mamma.

136
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Remarkable. The beasts have disappeared like ashes in the wind.

137
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Hey, come here.

138
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Look at the barrel.

139
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Animals are in the house.

140
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Father!

141
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,000
The men from the zoo are coming this way.

142
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Calm down and have fun.

143
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:45,000
We will defend you until the last Suomu and Viksikarva.

144
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Mom, coffee.

145
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Keep what you get.

146
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Good day!

147
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Good day!

148
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Good day!

149
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Hello everyone!

150
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Are you perhaps on a pleasure trip?

151
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Dear sir, we are from the zoo.

152
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Aha, in some course or not?

153
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Are you the owner of this house?

154
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
I am, I am Moomin-Daddy.

155
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Is there anything I can do for you?

156
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
You can.

157
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Release the animals you have hidden in your house.

158
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:44,000
I firmly believe that animals should be outside.

159
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Good sir, you can't see it from your chair, but the smoke from your pipe makes you glisten.

160
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Or am I asking?

161
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Yes, please.

162
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
It's not a catch.

163
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Right?

164
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,000
No, my daughter plays smoke in the pipe.

165
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:03,000
He enjoys it there.

166
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:07,000
We take the zoo's property to where it belongs.

167
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
You enter the hall.

168
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Let the animals out so we don't have to barge in.

169
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,000
There are no animals in my house.

170
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Wait a minute, sir seems to be alone among those hippos.

171
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:25,000
No, I'm Moomin-Pappa and the owner of this house.

172
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
You are a hippopotamus.

173
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Fuck you.

174
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:32,000
A hippo who owns a house and runs an illegal zoo.

175
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Scraper.

176
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
You are breaking my peace.

177
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:42,000
We don't even ask for a drawing. We have a suitably sized cage for you too.

178
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,000
If you break down the door, you will regret it.

179
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Really?

180
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Come on, we're going in now.

181
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Oh!

182
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
What does this mean?

183
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Oh look, the little one sells the police.

184
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,000
What do you think you're doing?

185
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:26,000
The precious animals of our zoo are hidden in this house.

186
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,000
We have come to get them away.

187
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:32,000
But a good man, you mustn't break other people's property.

188
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:36,000
We have to break down the door to get in.

189
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:40,000
How do you know zoo animals are in the house?

190
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
There is no doubt about it.

191
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Look at the chimney.

192
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,000
You see, there's a catch peeking out from there.

193
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Remarkable.

194
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Not about me.

195
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,000
A python's head was just bobbing up there.

196
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
I support.

197
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Now listen, men.

198
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Either you stop harassing your friend or I will arrest you.

199
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,000
But what about the animals in our zoo?

200
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,000
You heard what the police said, leave.

201
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Do you see?

202
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
What?

203
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Bring on the hippopotamus.

204
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
A hippopotamus?

205
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
It holds our animals.

206
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
I'm going to shut him down too.

207
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Or is that what you are planning?

208
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:30,000
They also want to capture the Moomin troll, the little girl and the Moomin mom.

209
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Criminal undercover project.

210
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Nope.

211
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Or abduction rather.

212
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
You can't kidnap a hippopotamus.

213
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
He is a Moomin.

214
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:43,000
I'm sure I can find reasons to stop you from paddling.

215
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Sorry for you.

216
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:49,000
However, I won't arrest you if you disappear within ten minutes.

217
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Let's throw the youths into the darkest pipe of the police chamber.

218
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:57,000
There, which rattles angry rats and spiders.

219
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Good idea.

220
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
They like animals.

221
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
I'll start counting now.

222
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
One.

223
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Two.

224
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Three.

225
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Hey guys, come on.

226
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Five.

227
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Six.

228
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
What are we doing?

229
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Tell me what you think?

230
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Poop, time is running out, you won't be able to lay eggs.

231
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Now say something.

232
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Minute.

233
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
A minute and a half.

234
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Two minutes were up.

235
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Close the bread door and disappear.

236
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:34,000
All right. Six minutes.

237
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Did you hear?

238
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
You're kidding.

239
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,000
The police don't play around. Nine and a half minutes.

240
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
What's up now?

241
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Nine minutes and forty seconds.

242
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Let's go, let's go.

243
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
We are still thinking about it.

244
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
And you won't think, let's go now.

245
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Oops, the zoo people are running away.

246
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Great, the Moomin Valley police chased them away.

247
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Don't ever come from Moomin Valley again, you'll end up behind bars.

248
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Bumpy, bumpy in front of it. Speed, speed.

249
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Thank you, little myy, for being smart enough to bring the police.

250
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:13,000
I wouldn't have had time to bite them all, there were too many of them.

251
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Come out.

252
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:31,000
So the animals were saved and could still enjoy the jungle with Moomin.

253
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:38,000
But one day the weather changed and cold winds blew over Moomin Valley.

254
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
The first day of autumn.

255
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:45,000
The jungle dies in this cold weather, and Mummy doesn't.

256
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
I'm afraid the worst.

257
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:52,000
The jungle grew so fast, maybe it will wither just as fast.

258
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
And so it withered.

259
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,000
The jungle withered in a single night.

260
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
The cold makes you feel down.

261
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
And the Moomin House can't be heated any more.

262
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,000
I miss the warmth of the zoo.

263
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Yes, it is very cold here.

264
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:10,000
We get warm if we burn the jungle!

265
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Sweet!

266
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Lovely warm.

267
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Sweet!

268
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Lovely warm.

269
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:00,000
That was the end of the jungle.

270
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
At least it was warm in Aki.

271
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
But here you are free.

272
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Free to suffer the cold.

273
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:11,000
I can't watch my man parka crawl here in the winter.

274
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:16,000
So all the animals decided to return to the zoo.

275
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:20,000
Maybe you can come again next summer.

276
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,000
It would be fun when there is a warm head.

277
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Oops, the animals come back.

278
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
How?

279
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:42,000
Nice to see you again, Rhino. Welcome.

280
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
No, hurry to the cages now.

281
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,000
We've kept them warm for you.

282
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,000
You look terrible, starving.

283
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:54,000
Let's cook something good for you tonight.

284
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
The hippos also came.

285
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
For the last time we are Moomins.

286
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
You must be very cold.

287
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,000
Let's warm up a nice cage for you too.

288
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,000
No, we just came to accompany our friends.

289
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,000
Hey, let the hippos in their cage.

290
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:13,000
Oh, it sounds corny, but we're Moomins.

291
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Yes, you will have fun here. You can eat as much hay as you can.

292
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
Do we look like hippos?

293
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:22,000
We know you're not clean-cut, but the public can't tell the difference.

294
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Father, do we have to stay here forever?

295
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,000
Of course not, I made something up.

296
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:32,000
Do you have some thoughts?

297
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:36,000
No, but they will. I'm a writer.

298
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
Hui.

299
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
Niskunemi, don't cry.

300
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,000
Yes, we get more food than hay.

301
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:48,000
To show nothing as long as we were.

302
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,000
That would be horrible. Once upon a time, it's unbearable.

303
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:55,000
Maybe the Moomin Valley police will come looking for us,

304
00:18:55,000 --> 00:19:00,000
when she notices that Moomin and Moomin's handbag are gone.

305
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
People are coming this way.

306
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Nuuska Muikkunen.

307
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,000
And Hemul.

308
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
And Little Myo.

309
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
Nuuska Muikkunen.

310
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
Muuska Muikkunen.

311
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
Muuska Muikkunen.

312
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
Muuska Muikkunen.

313
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
Muuska Muikkunen.

314
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:22,000
Hello Moomin, we came to let you out of the cage.

315
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
Please.

316
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,000
Good gentlemen, you were freed.

317
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
I was the manager of this zoo.

318
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:39,000
You will see that this was a quite understandable confusion.

319
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:42,000
We apologize on behalf of our board.

320
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:47,000
I went to the Science Academy with Pikku Myy and Vanhan Hemul.

321
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:54,000
We received a letter from the President of the Academy of Sciences proving that you are not hippos.

322
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,000
Please keep the valuable letter safe.

323
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:03,000
You can see it there again. You shouldn't judge based on the outer shell alone.

324
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,000
Listen mom.

325
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,000
That's what it sounds like.

326
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,000
Would I look less hippopotamus with a beard?

327
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
Hardly.

328
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,000
Autumn weather has arrived in Moomin Valley.

329
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:19,000
A new year began with new joys.
