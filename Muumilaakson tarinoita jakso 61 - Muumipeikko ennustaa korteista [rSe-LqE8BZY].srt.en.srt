1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,000
The morning in Moomin Valley seemed quite ordinary.

2
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:26,000
However, two days are never exactly alike, as we will soon see.

3
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:32,000
It is certainly nothing new that Nipsu dreams.

4
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Moomin, I can't carry that much.

5
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Please.

6
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Thanks mom.

7
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
In.

8
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Good morning.

9
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Good morning Miss Nipsu.

10
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
The Moomin is still in the room.

11
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Oh, then I'll go upstairs.

12
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Miss Nipsu is happy.

13
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
It seems so. It's very funny.

14
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
In.

15
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Good morning Moomin.

16
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Good morning. You are early.

17
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
What are you doing?

18
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I look at fate on the cards.

19
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Then I came appropriately. Tell me about my fate.

20
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Well, that's fine. Pick up the deck twice.

21
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Clear. Another time.

22
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Give me half the pack.

23
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Pick up the final pack two more times.

24
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Another time.

25
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Now. Touch the nose with the cards and immerse yourself in your thoughts.

26
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Touch the tip of the nose.

27
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Enough.

28
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Next, give me the top three cards.

29
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Do you see my destiny?

30
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Of course.

31
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
You have experienced something beautiful.

32
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Ai.

33
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Maybe a beautiful dream.

34
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Exactly.

35
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Do you know what happened to the dream?

36
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
That...

37
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
You got something you like.

38
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
That's what I got.

39
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Oh, you're really good at seeing.

40
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Did I get it right?

41
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,000
You hit it. I was dreaming and woke up just as you promised to give me a present.

42
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
What did you give me?

43
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
I don't know what I do in your dreams.

44
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
I look at the cards.

45
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
I fucked you. I can't see clearly.

46
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Don't be modest. You just proved yourself to be.

47
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Pure coincidence.

48
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Well, you would even try.

49
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Oh rot.

50
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Moomin! Moomin! Moomin!

51
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
What is it. You should be busy.

52
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Moomin troll. Now come now.

53
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Yeah, but...

54
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Right. If my gift is not more important to you than that.

55
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
I'm leaving.

56
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Not waiting.

57
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Let the lady go.

58
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Well miss, don't go.

59
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Moomin, let him go.

60
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
So, when the lady got hurt, tui.

61
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
I dreamed that you and I made a lot of money.

62
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Everyone dreams.

63
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Well, you come with me.

64
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
To do what?

65
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
This rejuvenator.

66
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Has passed in the mouth for decades.

67
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Let's start selling it.

68
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
To sell it?

69
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
We sell it by the ton.

70
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Then you can buy something for the wet ones.

71
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
And he will be happy.

72
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Ha, Hemuli is a suitable destination.

73
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Hemuli, you work hard.

74
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Kars, are you out and about today?

75
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
In the business world, there is talk.

76
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
That, we haven't met in a while.

77
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Oh, as I recall, the last time we met was yesterday.

78
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,000
I guess bending over is bad for the old back.

79
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Well, not really, when you can have fun.

80
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,000
But of course you would like to be younger.

81
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
A younger one?

82
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Of course.

83
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Moistelepas, or what it was like in your youth.

84
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
We have a rejuvenator.

85
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
We sell to you at a special price.

86
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
To be young.

87
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Experience all the thrills again.

88
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Girlfriends and late nights.

89
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
No thanks.

90
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
I am happy with my current situation.

91
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
My family has had a ton of bad luck.

92
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
I have to find another client.

93
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Another one?

94
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
I can't find anyone.

95
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
No one?

96
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Well, I don't, except maybe dad.

97
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
But I don't want to try the medicine on him.

98
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
No one believes in your medicine.

99
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Why not join the faith.

100
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Don't screw up.

101
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Do the drugs really work?

102
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Should we try its effect first?

103
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
For example, to you.

104
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
I don't want to be a rabbit.

105
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Besides, nobody wants to be younger.

106
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
At least I want to get older.

107
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Hip bone, is anyone home?

108
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Hip bone, is anyone home?

109
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Is there anyone at home?

110
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Looks like an oath.

111
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Hi huh, anyone there?

112
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Can't hear anything.

113
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Did someone yell at me?

114
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Hello, this is Moomin.

115
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
what did you say

116
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Moomin troll.

117
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Moomin!

118
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Well, I wish you a merry Christmas.

119
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
We have elixirs of rejuvenation.

120
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Want to try?

121
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Harder, I don't understand why everyone likes mummies these days.

122
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:41,000
I have elixir of rejuvenation.

123
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Do you want to try it?

124
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Do you provide free sample?

125
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
In that case, I won't say, no.

126
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Yeah, great stuff.

127
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,000
At least it is strong, I must say.

128
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Comfortably warms the heart underneath.

129
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Did he get younger?

130
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Now you can get over the medicine.

131
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
I shouldn't have added sprite.

132
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
I guess I can go home.

133
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
No, the business world knows no rest.

134
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
What tent is there?

135
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Excuse me, may I ask what are you waiting for?

136
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Well, to the clairvoyant.

137
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Oh yeah.

138
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Renowned.

139
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
This is our chance.

140
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
What do we mean?

141
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Let's get in line and ask how we become rich.

142
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
But I don't believe in clairvoyance.

143
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Me neither, but let's try.

144
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Come and be seen, young men, voice calls of fate.

145
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Sit down.

146
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,000
I think you guys are in trouble.

147
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
On.

148
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Are you looking for something?

149
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Yep, we're looking for a way to get rich.

150
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Not at all original.

151
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Pallo pallo show how to become rich, the owner of a thick bag, the bearer of gold illinkis.

152
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Now I see.

153
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
I don't see anything.

154
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
You're not supposed to see it.

155
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
What do you see?

156
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
I won't tell until you pay.

157
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
I don't have any money.

158
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:10,000
We will pay as soon as we can afford double the price.

159
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Triple.

160
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:17,000
The curse of danger will fall upon you if you slip.

161
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Honor in the word, we will not slip.

162
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Well then, I saw the shadow of a young woman.

163
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Really?

164
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Really.

165
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:33,000
The woman knows good luck, but watch out for the balloon.

166
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:37,000
A balloon predicts doom for you.

167
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:51,000
How do we get rich from women and balloons?

168
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Maybe we got to hear the truncated version because we didn't pay.

169
00:09:55,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Rubbish, the Clairvoyant guesses that everyone has worries and is looking for a solution to them.

170
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,000
And then he says whatever comes to mind.

171
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Haa!

172
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
What happened to you?

173
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Excuse me, how much is the tax for Selvnäkäki?

174
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Three gold coins.

175
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Three?

176
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Are you OK?

177
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Muvi veikko, a real lucky shot.

178
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
What?

179
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Let's become Clairvoyants.

180
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Again?

181
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Last time we asked for such a small fee that the audience became suspicious.

182
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,000
100 souls per day makes 300 gold coins.

183
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:48,000
During the week 2100, 1800 if we rest on Sunday.

184
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,000
More than 7000 per month!

185
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Nipsu honey, control yourself.

186
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Ai ai, kultavuori!

187
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Do you hold your nerve?

188
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:11,000
I don't want to be Clairvoyant, that's overkill.

189
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:15,000
That's what the people want, just like when they had breakfast in the morning.

190
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,000
I didn't get high, I was joking.

191
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Yuu-yuu, try to be like the real Clairvoyant and keep that joke down.

192
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
But...

193
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:29,000
When the customer comes, remember to say what is written on the paper.

194
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
I'll take care of the rest.

195
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Well, go get some customers.

196
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Hello, Nipsu!

197
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,000
What now? Is there a fire somewhere?

198
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Please come in.

199
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,000
A-a, payment in advance, I would refer.

200
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,000
No, Tipu, this was not my idea.

201
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
I want to hear my fate first.

202
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,000
It's fine, but the payments are made when I don't these days.

203
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:05,000
This is not my idea, I want to hear my fate first.

204
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:09,000
That's fine, but the payments will be made when our prediction has come true.

205
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
That's fine.

206
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Go further.

207
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,000
And then to the most important thing.

208
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Kasni, listen carefully to my words.

209
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Bad luck befalls you.

210
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Or so, and how?

211
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Well, that part is really unclear.

212
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Are you a clairvoyant at all?

213
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Oh, it's me. What can I say for a long time?

214
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Oh yes, a hint, I can give you a hint how you can avoid the danger.

215
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Ha, well, what clue could that be?

216
00:12:54,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Bring it like that, don't look up, because danger lurks below.

217
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
A rather obscure clue.

218
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Yes, it says here though.

219
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Where does it say?

220
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Nowhere. I mean the cards say so.

221
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Cards, cards, cards, cards.

222
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Significant cards.

223
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Yeah, yeah.

224
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Don't think I'm paying for that nonsense.

225
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Haa.

226
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Hello, what did you find out?

227
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:37,000
A lot of bullshit, and I'm not going to pay you a dime for it, okay?

228
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Be careful, the forecast is valid until the evening.

229
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Isn't it a beautiful day?

230
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Good.

231
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Did it happen, bad luck to fall into a pit.

232
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
It's okay.

233
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Prediction.

234
00:13:54,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Is this what was predicted for you? In that case, unfortunately, you will have to pay.

235
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Moomin, Moomin.

236
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Behold, Great success.

237
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Was the customer and others staying?

238
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Moomin, Moomin.

239
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Behold, Great success.

240
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Did the customer not seem to believe.

241
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,000
I made him believe, see.

242
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:23,000
I'll get more customers, we'll be rich.

243
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Don't look up, keep your eyes on the ground.

244
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Happiness I know you will get then.

245
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,000
It's just a bay.

246
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
He spoke the truth.

247
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:49,000
That's what he always says. The fee is four gold coins, please.

248
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:53,000
The cards say that the sky will open above you.

249
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
He knew.

250
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
This should work.

251
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:11,000
You may encounter a ghost, but don't say anything to it.

252
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Especially don't get too close, or it will bite your nose off.

253
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Oh no, I'm so afraid of ghosts.

254
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:25,000
There's no reason to worry as long as you don't get too close.

255
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:32,000
I shouldn't have come, it would be clear the seer is, surely wrong.

256
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Ghost ball!

257
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Stupid freak out paint balloon.

258
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Tremble that mortal.

259
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Cry?

260
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,000
I'm right behind you.

261
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:01,000
That you dare, only members of the ghost association have the right to haunt.

262
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Sorry, not me ever again.

263
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Well, I guess not.

264
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Hemp Haunters ruin the reputation of ghosts.

265
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:13,000
As punishment, I'll haunt you every night for a week.

266
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:16,000
No, no, no, no, no, don't, don't, don't, don't.

267
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Here's honey, hold, hold the whole bag.

268
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
Wait, wait.

269
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Aaaaaa!

270
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:35,000
It's strange what the customers were looking for.

271
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:38,000
And where Nipsun Mokoma would hide.

272
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
Experience!

273
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,000
That's the tent.

274
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Good day.

275
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Are you a card fortune teller?

276
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,000
It's me.

277
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Good.

278
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:03,000
I've heard how fairy-tale predictions come true every day.

279
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
Can we start?

280
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
SAMATO.

281
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
What do you want to know?

282
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Well, now that the masquerade competition is organized,

283
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,000
and I don't know if I would participate in it.

284
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
Or a costume contest?

285
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,000
So.

286
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,000
I don't really want to participate in the competition,

287
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
if I stay in last place.

288
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:28,000
You won't be the last.

289
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,000
I should come up with a very special costume.

290
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Too bad I don't know what it would be like.

291
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:39,000
I have to come up with a costume that won't blow anyone else's head.

292
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
What if you were a mermaid?

293
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
Mermaid?

294
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Yeah, I saw shoes as jewelry.

295
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:52,000
Mom can make a suit.

296
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,000
Huh?

297
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,000
Yes, mother agrees.

298
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
You will win, mister.

299
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
How do you know my name?

300
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
Well, here I am.

301
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
Remember the rest.

302
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
Well, here I am.

303
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:08,000
Moomin, how are you here?

304
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
It's quite a long story.

305
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,000
Let's go home and prepare the suit.

306
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
Will you help me, Moomin?

307
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Of course.

308
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,000
Everyone helps.

309
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:21,000
A few lobster shells and maybe an old fishing net.

310
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
Sounds wonderful.

311
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Well, let's go.

312
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:28,000
You got a beautiful necklace.

313
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Yeah, a reasonable reward.

314
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
My victory is thanks to Moomin.

315
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
Well, there were others of us.

316
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
I collected some nice shells.

317
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:40,000
But the mermaid costume was Moomin's idea.

318
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,000
I told you that you are a good clairvoyant.

319
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
Elevators.

320
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:49,000
How exactly did you end up in the soothsayer's tent?

321
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
What is it?

322
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
I just remembered Nipsu.

323
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,000
Nipsun?

324
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
Nipsu, are you at home?

325
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
Moomin!

326
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
What now?

327
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
You left me stranded.

328
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
That ghost scared me to death.

329
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
And I haven't dared to go out.

330
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
Ghost?

331
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,000
Just right.

332
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
It got mad when I haunted.

333
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:23,000
I had to give it all my, all our gold coins.

334
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
The head is fine, Nipsu.

335
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:30,000
Now let's go celebrate Niiskuneidi's first prize in the masquerade costume competition.

336
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
Funny costume.

337
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:35,000
Nuthead! Niiskuneiti is a mermaid!

338
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:38,000
I received this necklace as a reward.

339
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
Or as a reward?

340
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:44,000
Wedding! Onni kicked Niiskuneit.

341
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
You can say that.

342
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,000
The clear seer was right when he spoke about the young woman.

343
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:52,000
But good luck didn't meet us.

344
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
How about a balloon?

345
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:58,000
I forgot the prediction and painted the Ghost on the balloon.

346
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
Just a coincidence, I guess.

347
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
I never believe in clairvoyance.

348
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:06,000
Me neither. Even to that one.

349
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,000
A pinch! I'm you rushing now?

350
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:15,000
I go back to the clairvoyant and ask how one can preserve one's wealth.

351
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:20,000
I think Nipsu can be changed into something else.

352
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,000
Gold is Nipsu's only fixed point.

353
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:27,000
Clear seer! Where are you?

354
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
Clear seer!
