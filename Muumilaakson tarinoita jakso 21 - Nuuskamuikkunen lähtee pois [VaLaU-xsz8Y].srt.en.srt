1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,200
Individual

2
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:17,200
Autumn has arrived in Moominvalley. The days are getting shorter and the summer blue sky has turned gray and cloudy.

3
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:20,200
Iskureiti!

4
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:26,200
where are you going

5
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:29,200
I'm taking lunch to my talented brother.

6
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:33,200
I guess the flight deck is getting ready.

7
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:36,200
Not even when you work so hard.

8
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:38,200
Have you seen a raccoon?

9
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:42,200
I don't. He won't even let me in the shed. Can you imagine?

10
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:44,200
Can't anyone see his mess?

11
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:51,200
Of course not. Great inventors must always exercise extreme caution. You understand he.

12
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:54,200
Kuvi, Teikko wants to see a flying kite?

13
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:56,200
I know.

14
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:04,200
Hey, open up. I only have two hands and both are occupied.

15
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:08,200
You see. A real gramophone.

16
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:21,200
Daddy, can you fix it?

17
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:23,200
With pleasure.

18
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:25,200
Where did it come from?

19
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:27,400
Daddy, can you fix it?

20
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:29,400
With pleasure.

21
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:34,400
Why is it that I'm always given junk items that don't work?

22
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:39,400
Papa can fix the gramophone.

23
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:45,400
My aunt said that the record is completely playable and contains beautiful dance music.

24
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:52,400
Oh right. It's been a while since I last spun around on the dance floor. Did you hear that, papa?

25
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:54,600
Or didn't spin?

26
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:56,600
Oops, it's been a week here.

27
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:58,600
Can you fix it?

28
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:09,600
Hear the music.

29
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:11,600
Maybe some real dance music.

30
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:23,600
Drink.

31
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:42,600
Did you figure out how to dance?

32
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:44,600
I think I got to the point.

33
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:46,600
So do I.

34
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:48,600
Then dance.

35
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:50,600
Joo.

36
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,400
You are amazing, Lady.

37
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:57,400
Nukro!

38
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:07,400
Moomin, look at papa, he was hard to dance.

39
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,400
Nipsuo, can you dance?

40
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,400
I have not experimented.

41
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:24,400
Well, let's try then.

42
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,400
Oh, that was fun.

43
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:55,400
The record must be playing at overspeed.

44
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:58,400
You don't have the slightest sense of rhythm.

45
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:01,400
It's possible, let's dance.

46
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:03,400
Another song.

47
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:05,400
Sorry, I have to rant.

48
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:07,400
Shawl.

49
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:13,400
No thanks, I dance alone.

50
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:15,400
So.

51
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:18,400
No thanks, I dance alone.

52
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:21,400
Nipsuo, come dance with me.

53
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:23,400
It's fine.

54
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:33,400
Who?

55
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:39,400
Yes, it can rain there.

56
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:47,400
You must be like a bathed dog.

57
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:49,400
I am.

58
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:51,400
You guys are having fun.

59
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:58,400
Yes, Nipsu brought the gramophone and we've been dancing for a long time with all our heart's desire.

60
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:01,400
I can already smell the scent of winter in the air.

61
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:03,400
Yes?

62
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:06,400
I guess you're right.

63
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:18,400
I'm snuffling.

64
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:26,400
Sniff me, come dance.

65
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:28,400
No thanks, I can't.

66
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:35,400
Sorry.

67
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:37,400
Sorry again.

68
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:39,400
Sorry.

69
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:41,400
Yes.

70
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:43,400
About.

71
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:49,400
There was an error again.

72
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:51,400
Just when we were having so much fun.

73
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:53,400
Could you fix it again?

74
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:55,400
My skills are not enough.

75
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:57,400
Dad try, you are so clever.

76
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:59,400
Come on, sniveling little one.

77
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:01,400
Do you know anything about gramophones?

78
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:03,400
I don't, unfortunately.

79
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:05,400
We have nothing.

80
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:07,400
Do you know anything about gramophones?

81
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:09,400
I don't, unfortunately.

82
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:10,400
I thought.

83
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:11,400
But...

84
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:12,400
So?

85
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:15,400
I play the harmonica while you tinker with the gramophone.

86
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:17,400
The dance can continue.

87
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:19,400
It's a great snuff, little one.

88
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:21,400
Thanks.

89
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:23,400
Would this be a suitable dance song?

90
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:37,400
Thanks.

91
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:03,400
I give up.

92
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:07,400
I am.

93
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:29,400
You're thinking about going away again, aren't you?

94
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:33,400
I know winter is coming and you go south every year.

95
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:38,400
down south every year, but I'll still miss you.

96
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:40,400
Tasteless Peikko.

97
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:49,400
What's over there?

98
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:51,400
Hats, I guess.

99
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:53,400
Where are they going?

100
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:56,400
To some island where there are no others.

101
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:59,400
When are you going to leave?

102
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:02,400
Sniff, when?

103
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:04,400
I haven't decided yet.

104
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:07,400
So will you stay for a while?

105
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:10,400
Do you know where you are going?

106
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:11,400
In.

107
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:13,400
I guess hiking is fun.

108
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:15,400
Share mostly.

109
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:19,400
It's the best way to enjoy solitude.

110
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:25,400
We hibernate, but we are not sleepy even when we sleep.

111
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:30,400
If I had to stay here all winter, I would surely hibernate.

112
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:35,400
Muuska Muikkunen

113
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:40,400
Couldn't we go with Muikkunen to the south?

114
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:47,400
In our family, we hibernate.

115
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:52,400
It is the old way of our ancestors and we follow it.

116
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:58,400
I don't want to, I'm not going to sleep without snuff with Muikkunen to the south.

117
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:03,400
Moomin, would you come back on the first day of spring?

118
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:08,400
Mom, does this mean I get to go?

119
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:10,400
Will you give me permission to leave?

120
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:15,400
If you have such a severe cold, we will prevent it. Or what?

121
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:21,400
My relatives didn't stop me when I wanted to travel around the world.

122
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:26,400
Oh thanks dad. Thanks mom.

123
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:29,400
What does snuff Muikkunen think?

124
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:38,400
No doubt it would be fun if a Moomin came along.

125
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:42,400
Yep, I'll come with you then.

126
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:43,400
No.

127
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:44,400
Why not?

128
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:46,400
I'm going alone.

129
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:49,400
I'm going south to be alone.

130
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:52,400
My soul demands it after my time here.

131
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:55,400
Just as my soul demands to be here after loneliness.

132
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:58,400
And going back is always just as fun.

133
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:01,400
Yeah, but what about me?

134
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:05,400
I'll see you again next spring as always.

135
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:09,400
I promise you I'll be back on the first day of spring.

136
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:14,400
I'm sitting on the railing of the bridge and through the window you can hear me playing my lip harp.

137
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:17,400
I came up with a new tune for spring.

138
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:27,400
Speak up.

139
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:40,400
I'm sorry for you.

140
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:43,400
A little about that.

141
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:49,400
Oh, oh. You'd have to make that bundle a little tighter.

142
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:55,400
We need a lot of cracks in the coming cold winter.

143
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:59,400
I'm sure you'll stay warm.

144
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:04,400
When I grow up, I too will go south alone.

145
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:06,400
That's fine.

146
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:23,400
Is Moomin at home?

147
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:25,400
On, on.

148
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:29,400
How is he? Is he still slobbering?

149
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:33,400
Yet. Although I tried her grandmother's best recipe.

150
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:37,400
And all just because it hurts when he leaves.

151
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:39,400
So.

152
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:41,400
But not bigger.

153
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:45,400
I have a surprise for Moomin that will surely cheer him up.

154
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:51,400
Haa.

155
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:07,400
Moomin, are you there?

156
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:09,400
Hi dear Moomin, don't cry.

157
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:11,400
Men don't cry.

158
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:12,400
Cry, you little Hubsu.

159
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:14,400
At least I'm not crying.

160
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:17,400
All right. You should get up though.

161
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:19,400
I don't care.

162
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:21,400
I have a surprise for you.

163
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:23,400
I don't mind surprises.

164
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:26,400
When driving, you can look at Niisku. Come along. Come on.

165
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:29,400
You know very well that Niisku won't let us there.

166
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:32,400
Let's go. Today he lets go.

167
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:36,400
You don't mean he's going to show us his flywheel?

168
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:37,400
I mean.

169
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:39,400
Is it finally ready?

170
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:42,400
No, there's still an awful lot to do.

171
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:45,400
How in the world is Niisku showing us his bullshit?

172
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:48,400
He has always turned me back before.

173
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:53,400
In order to bend Niisku, you need feminine charm and cunning.

174
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:55,400
How did you manage?

175
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:58,400
Well, first. Niisku flatly said no.

176
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:04,400
But when I told you how sick you are and that maybe we shouldn't keep you around much longer, Niisku said.

177
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:06,400
I don't. I'm so sick.

178
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:08,400
Nice to hear.

179
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:12,400
Oh, you know that depressed people sometimes do desperate things.

180
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:15,400
Niisku miss, thanks for cheering me up.

181
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:23,400
And remember, no one will know about this. Don't ever tell a soul.

182
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:25,400
Clear.

183
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:35,400
Let's go.

184
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:44,400
Retail.

185
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:46,400
Now we are in the broth.

186
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:48,400
And bad.

187
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:50,400
Gotta pull him by the lip.

188
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:52,400
But how?

189
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:54,400
Now I know how we handle the sale.

190
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:56,400
How?

191
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:58,400
You just accept everything I say.

192
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:00,400
Good.

193
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:02,400
I thought you were bedridden.

194
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:04,400
No, we're going to Niiskunluo.

195
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:06,400
Halveli is ready, right?

196
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:08,400
I'm ready.

197
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:11,400
No, we're going to Niiskunluo.

198
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:13,400
Halveli is ready, right?

199
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:15,400
No, but Niisku needs Silä airport.

200
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:17,400
We're going to help him.

201
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:21,400
Have you gotten up from your sick bed to help Niiskua?

202
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:25,400
To get stumps and tear up roots from the ground.

203
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:29,400
Maybe you've noticed that I'm not a complete fool.

204
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:31,400
I spoke the truth.

205
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:36,400
Take it as a personal insult that you couldn't come up with a better emergency lie.

206
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:39,400
And you're still pushing the scumbag as the truth.

207
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:42,400
I'm telling the truth. Isn't it just Niiskunneiti?

208
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:44,400
Not a word more.

209
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:46,400
You are trying to hide something from me.

210
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:53,400
But I can't bear to be interested in any of the slytherins and sly-like woods you move about.

211
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:54,400
But sell.

212
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:56,400
No problem.

213
00:14:56,400 --> 00:15:00,400
I happen to be too busy to care to listen to that bullshit right now.

214
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:03,400
It was on point.

215
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:05,400
It was.

216
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:14,400
Oh, they think they can keep a secret from me.

217
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:25,400
There are no others with you.

218
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:27,400
Well, of course not, I promised.

219
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:29,400
Please come in.

220
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:37,400
Ooo.

221
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:46,400
It's almost done.

222
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:49,400
No, no, no, no, no, no, no. The machinery is just in its infancy.

223
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:52,400
And as you can see, the ship itself is quite interesting.

224
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:55,400
I couldn't imagine that the ship looks so wonderful.

225
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:59,400
Well, presumably the design has not gone completely wild.

226
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:04,400
I'm sure it will fly beautifully.

227
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:07,400
Do you, do you really think so, Muun Pekko?

228
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:12,400
I see with the eyes of my soul your ship soars already made on high.

229
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:15,400
I'm sure it will fly beautifully.

230
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:18,400
Do you, do you really think so, Muun Pekko?

231
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:23,400
I see with the eyes of my soul your ship already flying high in the sky.

232
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:26,400
Thank you, Moomin Pekko.

233
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:29,400
I think you are right.

234
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:33,400
It's funny to see that you are so unusually far-sighted.

235
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:36,400
But hurry up now, Moomin Pekko.

236
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:39,400
Or is this what you wanted to keep from me?

237
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:44,400
Sell, how did you get in?

238
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:46,400
Out the door, Tollo.

239
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:48,400
But it's always...

240
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:53,400
I forgot to lock the door.

241
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:56,400
And now it's too late, but don't be sad.

242
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:59,400
If I want to come in, I'll come too.

243
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:01,400
You lied to us.

244
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:04,400
That's true, but you lied to me too.

245
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:06,400
And now everything is fine.

246
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:10,400
Listen, little guy, don't tell anyone what you see or hear here.

247
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:12,400
Agreed.

248
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:19,400
Well, the remarkable invention before you has so many excellent new features,

249
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:23,400
that it is difficult to choose where to start listing them.

250
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:26,400
But let's first take...

251
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:45,400
Rate.

252
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:11,400
Tomorrow Pekko, I want to stay on the shore of that lake.

253
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:13,400
Why do you want to leave?

254
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:16,400
Wouldn't it be much more fun to fly?

255
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:18,400
I want to be one.

256
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:22,400
Snuff, do you want to come guide?

257
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:24,400
I don't care.

258
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:27,400
Bye!

259
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:34,400
Snuff!

260
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:43,400
Uuuh!

261
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:54,400
Goodbye, Moomin.

262
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:56,400
We will meet again next year.

263
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:58,400
On the first day of spring.

264
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:13,400
Goodbye, Snuff!

265
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:44,400
Heading south again?

266
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:47,400
I'm leaving. See you Hemuli.

267
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:49,400
I care about you.

268
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:51,400
So do you.

269
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:02,400
I haven't noticed that winter is so close already.

270
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:13,400
Moomin troll
