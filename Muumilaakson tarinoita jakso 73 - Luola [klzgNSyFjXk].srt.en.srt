00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
One day, Moomin and his friends went on a trip to a special, completely round island.

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
You have a long way to go. I put extra food in my backpack just in case.

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Thanks. Come back at low tide or you will have to stay on the island for the entire high tide. And be careful.

4
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
If you set off now, you should reach the island.

5
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
So what if the water rises when we're halfway there?

6
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Nipsu, it doesn't happen that fast. We will leave for the return journey in good time.

7
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
But how do we know what is early?

8
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Don't do it, Muredi. When it's time to come back, I'll let you know with a proper thump. You can even hear it on the far shore.

9
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Are you absolutely sure?

10
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I'm always sure.

11
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Bye.

12
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Have fun.

13
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Take care of my sister.

14
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Fool. I can take care of myself.

15
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Too difficult.

16
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Pinch, come on!

17
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
What's wrong with you? You look worried.

18
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
What if the high tide falls on us anyway?

19
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Is that why you wear a stupid life jacket?

20
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:29,000
The tide follows the moon, and the moon never knows where it is going.

21
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Nipsu, you are amazing. Are you not interested in a treasure chest buried on an island?

22
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Ooo, aare?

23
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
You haven't heard, have you?

24
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Wake up.

25
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Hey.

26
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Oh round island.

27
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000
I tell you what. The water has already receded. I'm running a race to the island.

28
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Y, you, you, ny.

29
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Most creative, Pekko, you stole.

30
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
I don't even have access.

31
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
It's a hill.

32
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Ha, ha, ha.

33
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
I'll tell you what to do with me.

34
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Hey.

35
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Oh.

36
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Moomi Pekka.

37
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Oh dear Pekka, look how cute I found some nice shoes.

38
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Wow, they are beautiful. Especially that pair of glasses.

39
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Then you get it.

40
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Oh, thank you.

41
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Ha, ha, ha.

42
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Ha, hooray, I caught it.

43
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Look, Nipsu, a real octopus.

44
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Up.

45
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Nipsu, what are you standing there mumbling about?

46
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:49,000
I watched the sea so that it wouldn't suddenly sneak up on us.

47
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
You can't even see it, you idiot.

48
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
I'm going to look for a better spot.

49
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
A pinch.

50
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Loggerhead.

51
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
At least I can't see anything from here.

52
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Ha, Kalli is going in every direction.

53
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Hard to climb.

54
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Ha, real amethysts.

55
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Where am I?

56
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Haa.

57
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Oh, how beautiful and precious.

58
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
And how much.

59
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Haa.

60
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Haa.

61
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Haa.

62
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Luck.

63
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
I got it.

64
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Haa.

65
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Do you think these are enough?

66
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Yeh, thanks.

67
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
What exactly are you doing?

68
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Can't you join?

69
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,000
We are building a lodge. Come help.

70
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,000
The house is too small for all of us.

71
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
What's in the office?

72
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Strange, I haven't seen Nipsu at all.

73
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Me neither, it's wonderfully peaceful.

74
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Let's go Nipsua gone.

75
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Curious thing.

76
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Hi, Nipsu.

77
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Pinch.

78
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
He has gone home alone.

79
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
And no, he would have said.

80
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Nipsu, hi, where are you?

81
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
It rained.

82
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
About.

83
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,000
It's now ten past ten.

84
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Aha.

85
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
I want to see how your cannon works.

86
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
It works well.

87
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:47,000
I designed it for the launch of my aircraft.

88
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Well, plug your ears.

89
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Wake up.

90
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Moisture.

91
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000
So yeah, I didn't take the rain into account.

92
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Pinch.

93
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Nipsuu, where are you?

94
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Come here.

95
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Where has he disappeared to?

96
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,000
The water has started to rise again.

97
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,000
The water has started to rise again.

98
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Oh-oh-oh, help, help, Moomin!

99
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Oops, water has entered.

100
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Aa.

101
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Aa.

102
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Ah, amethysts.

103
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,000
I didn't even see a wish.

104
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,000
I have found an amethyst cave.

105
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
What a stroke of luck.

106
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,000
More valuable than a treasure chest in a cave.

107
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Wake up.

108
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,000
How do I get out of here?

109
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Moomin!

110
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Hoi!

111
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Help, help!

112
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:06,000
I would have loved to know that gunpowder gets wet in the rain.

113
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
I didn't expect rain.

114
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Hurry up, let's get to the island.

115
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:24,000
There is currently a full moon and the tide is particularly high.

116
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Evil!

117
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Pinch!

118
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Nipsuu, where have they been?

119
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Pinch!

120
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Listen!

121
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Have you found a trinket?

122
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,000
In the meantime, the water is so high that we can't get back.

123
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
What?

124
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,000
We are lost, good fellow.

125
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Niisku he promised to bang when it's time for us to return.

126
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,000
But the sea is rolling towards us.

127
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Building a house was not the craziest idea after all.

128
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
You have to find a pinch.

129
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
So.

130
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Pinch!

131
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Come forth, Rumilus!

132
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Pinch!

133
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Water is flowing.

134
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,000
If the water gets in, I get out.

135
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Uvi papa, we can't get to the island at high tide.

136
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,000
We have to come up with something else.

137
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Yes, we will get to the island.

138
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Let's kiss only those who are more pontificating.

139
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Hey!

140
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Hey!

141
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Ai!

142
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Ai!

143
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Ai!

144
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Ai!

145
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Moomin papa, nothing will come of this.

146
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Did you come up with something?

147
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
The current seems to be getting stronger.

148
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Cave mouth rescue.

149
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Ai!

150
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Ai!

151
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Ai!

152
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
To the profession!

153
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Moomin goblin, come help!

154
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
It sounded like Nipsu's voice to me.

155
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Ai!

156
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
I didn't hear.

157
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Moomin troll!

158
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Your nip is...

159
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Pinch, where are you?

160
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Moomin goblin, help!

161
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Moomin goblin, come help!

162
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
The sound comes from the cave.

163
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
A pinch!

164
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
How did you get there?

165
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
It's not important.

166
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Help out!

167
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Fun, at least the rain stopped.

168
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
How are you doing?

169
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
I won't come.

170
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
The books advise you to do this.

171
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
But have the authors tried?

172
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
I'm terribly hungry.

173
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Did Evaskor have something to hawk?

174
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Left.

175
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Let's heat the leftovers with a campfire,

176
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
when Moomin has first started the fire.

177
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Finally, the deer collects dry leaves.

178
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Clear.

179
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Nipsu, you're coming to help me.

180
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Neither do I.

181
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
I'm going back to the cave to get more amethysts.

182
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
There is no time for that.

183
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
I'll help or eat your share.

184
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
You're so lazy.

185
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Hold on.

186
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Will anything come of it?

187
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Absolutely.

188
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
According to the bills, I can fly from here.

189
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
I took the rope with me to the island.

190
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
When I got to the island,

191
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
I'll pull the boat over there.

192
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
The plan can't fail I swear it.

193
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
All right.

194
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Now I'm leaving.

195
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Good.

196
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Slaughterhouse, slaughterhouse.

197
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Gathers its wings.

198
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Piemälä on the island.

199
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
This works as I designed.

200
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
I have misjudged my own strength.

201
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Don't worry, Nisku.

202
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Don't fall.

203
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Don't fall.

204
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Don't fall.

205
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Please help.

206
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Don't fall.

207
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Nisku, are you okay?

208
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
I believe so.

209
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Thanks for the help, Snuff-muikkunen.

210
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Think nothing of it.

211
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
What the hell are you doing here in the middle of the night?

212
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Moomin and his friends are on the island relying on their own luck.

213
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Blocked by water.

214
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:46,000
We have tried to save them without success.

215
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Or like that?

216
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Please wait for the next low tide.

217
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:54,000
I'm sure they'll find some shelter from the rain.

218
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Hopefully.

219
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
It's not even cold now.

220
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:02,000
They have spent the night under the open sky before.

221
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Well, they are.

222
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
We are waiting for low water from tomorrow.

223
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Snuff-muikkunen, what things do you use to move?

224
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:14,000
I came to see the round island.

225
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Why?

226
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
You can see the incredible.

227
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:22,000
In case the fog clears up a bit.

228
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
What was that sound?

229
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
There was a rumble somewhere.

230
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
The waves are roaring!

231
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
And not.

232
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
The sound comes from underground.

233
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Thanks.

234
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Thanks.

235
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
What was it?

236
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
The ground shook.

237
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
Would you mind?

238
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Omi-Pekka!

239
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
The sound is coming from here.

240
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Don't go there, you will be in danger.

241
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
Please wait for me.

242
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
The sound is close.

243
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
The sound is close.

244
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
Hats.

245
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
Hattivats compete.

246
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
They have fun.

247
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
LKKK

248
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
Am I still asleep?

249
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
I don't do that...

250
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
They must have left.

251
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:59,720
The water is falling! We're getting home, hooray!

252
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:09,720
Collect!

253
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:11,720
Sniff it up!

254
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:13,720
Moaning!

255
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:17,720
Father!

256
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:19,720
And Moisture!

257
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:22,720
Dad, hello! Wake up!

258
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:24,720
Niisku, what's yours?

259
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:26,720
There is! It's morning!

260
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:31,720
Moomin!

261
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:34,720
Sister, why are you loitering here?

262
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:38,720
Moomin, are you all right? Didn't he catch a cold in the rain?

263
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:40,720
Of course not.

264
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:42,720
I brought you beautiful shoes too.

265
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:44,720
Thanks.

266
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:46,720
You look at this.

267
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:48,720
It's beautiful. Amethyst huh?

268
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:50,720
Absolutely.

269
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:54,720
I had many amethysts, but they fell into the water.

270
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:56,720
Let's go get them sometime.

271
00:19:56,720 --> 00:20:00,720
And we see something extraordinarily beautiful on the island.

272
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:04,720
Ice. Let's go home. Mamma must be worried already.

273
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:06,720
Let's go!

274
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:08,720
Stay tuned!

275
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:13,720
No!

276
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:15,720
Moominpapa, you have a cold.

277
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:19,720
And you look very tired, good police chief.

278
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:22,720
Let's go drink some cocoa. You too, Niisku.

279
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:24,720
Joo.
