1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:20,000
So when Eiti runs as if Mörkö is on her hips, I've hardly ever seen her run as fast.

2
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
What is the matter now?

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Granny Goblin! Grandma help me!

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Calm down, tell me what's wrong.

5
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
My brother is going to jump off a cliff.

6
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Nice to meet you.

7
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I hurt him.

8
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
He says he'll jump anyway.

9
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Granny Goblin, stop it.

10
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
So Eiti, how can I help?

11
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
So you can't jump from the southern slope of the cliff.

12
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Oh, he's the type.

13
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
So when you go on a test flight.

14
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Good vibes.

15
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:20,000
So, Eiti, do you mean that your brother's flying horse is finally finished?

16
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Oh no, Blueprint probably just.

17
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
That's already something.

18
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
He has built the model pieces of the wings of his future flying kite.

19
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
But to me they look far too flimsy to be worth it.

20
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
They will never be able to support him, never.

21
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Ahaa, share, and now that you are going to try in practice how the wings of the flight attractor work.

22
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Prevents his experiment.

23
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Block the father.

24
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Did you say south facing slope?

25
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
I said, it is the steepest and the highest.

26
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Then speed up everything.

27
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Not enough time to waste.

28
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Oh, thank you, Grandma, thank you.

29
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Now.

30
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Niisku, at least those my brothers.

31
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Stand Niisku, don't jump.

32
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Why have you dragged everyone here?

33
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000
You are far too young to end your day so mournfully.

34
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Fortunately, we managed to save you.

35
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
No ettepäs.

36
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Get wet!

37
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Seems like a dangerous experiment.

38
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
I built the wings myself.

39
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
A strong argument, but still.

40
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,000
I have made exact blue copies. The wings are safe.

41
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Why did you stop suddenly when you were running fast down the slope?

42
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
I measured how much speed I needed.

43
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Don't jump, Niisku. I don't want to lose you.

44
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Don't whine, Niisku-neiti.

45
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Can the wings be trusted?

46
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Of course, birds don't fall from the sky either.

47
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Why not try flying closer to the ground?

48
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
That way you won't hurt yourself if you fall.

49
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
I already tried. I successfully jumped from the roof of the house.

50
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Can you see?

51
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
That's how it happened.

52
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
I don't think I'm going to jump in front of the rabbit pants.

53
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
So what did that mean?

54
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
It's just that I don't want you to push one.

55
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
So what did that mean?

56
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:11,000
It's just that I don't want you to push one measure of your big scum into my affairs.

57
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
My business is just as big.

58
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
I don't want to lose you.

59
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Then don't continue.

60
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Let's start being people.

61
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Varukaa.

62
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Whoops. I don't think your brother's intentions can be prevented.

63
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Niisku, you are brave.

64
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Now to do it.

65
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
This time I'll take a proper start.

66
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Oh, isn't there Nuuska Muikkunen over there?

67
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Where is Nuuska Muikkunen?

68
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
You won't see him for that. Get up here.

69
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Where is it?

70
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Down there.

71
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
I mumble!

72
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Hi! Did you hear here?

73
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
I guess not.

74
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Now let's go.

75
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Good luck on your journey.

76
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
It works.

77
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Oh.

78
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
It's damp.

79
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
impressive

80
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:35,920
and

81
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:46,880
it's like

82
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,400
Oh, wonderful!

83
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:07,400
Do you see, Niskunneiti? Brother on display, this fills the cage!

84
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:13,240
Oh, he indulged...

85
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:15,120
I thought he would make it.

86
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:17,440
Truth be told, so do I.

87
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:18,400
Ai...

88
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:20,640
Yeah, yeah, Nisku!

89
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:25,240
Low!

90
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:27,200
Low!

91
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:29,200
Misko!

92
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:34,840
Hey!

93
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:39,560
Good, good!

94
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:42,640
The trial will be a resounding success.

95
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:59,200
Hey!

96
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:10,240
As I thought, he can't fly and splash at the same time.

97
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:12,240
You are low.

98
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:15,240
He will fall if you wave with either hand.

99
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:20,240
Stink, you are not needed here. Get out of here right away.

100
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:23,240
That trick could be useful.

101
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:26,240
I'll go if you stay.

102
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:31,280
It would be suitable for robberies, because you could get over high fences.

103
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:37,280
The wind blows the breeze into the sea.

104
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:40,280
Why didn't you turn around and come back?

105
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:43,280
It can be difficult to change direction.

106
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:45,280
Maybe you can turn around.

107
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:47,280
Of course, you can't.

108
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:52,280
Hello! What is this? I can't turn around.

109
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:58,280
Hey!

110
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:07,280
He hit a tree. Quick help.

111
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:28,280
Did he die?

112
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:30,280
No, got a concussion.

113
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:34,280
Looks dead. And where are the wings?

114
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:36,280
They stayed up.

115
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:39,280
Niisku is tired of Takuu's wings.

116
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:41,280
I'll get them.

117
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:59,280
The test flight went well, huh?

118
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:03,280
Yeah, I guess. Except at the end.

119
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:10,280
I'm pretty sure all you need is more practice.

120
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:14,280
Well, share, if only iodine and plasters are enough.

121
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:16,280
I hear you, Niisku.

122
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:17,280
So?

123
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:20,280
Oh, are you still using it?

124
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:22,280
In.

125
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:25,320
I want to float in the sky too.

126
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:29,320
It looks like the funniest thing I've ever seen in my life.

127
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:35,320
Yes, but the flight characteristics of the wings should be tested.

128
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:40,320
Of course, that's clear. I'll try for you.

129
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:44,320
Could you maybe give it a try?

130
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:46,320
Joo.

131
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:50,360
That's clear. I'll try for you.

132
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:55,360
Could you possibly help somehow, Moomin?

133
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:58,360
You didn't answer yet, can I have wings?

134
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:00,360
You can. On one condition.

135
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:02,360
Agree to anything?

136
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:08,360
Now that I have the blue copies ready and the wings are more or less in order,

137
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:12,360
I need a place to build my mess.

138
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:14,360
That's what you really need.

139
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:19,400
It doesn't have to be spectacular, as long as it's on top of the roof,

140
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:25,400
that no one can spy and steal my wonderful invention.

141
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:27,400
You get wings for help.

142
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:29,400
Agreed.

143
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:37,400
I would have helped anyway, but now that I'm getting my wings, I work with double the enthusiasm.

144
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:40,400
It's a great thing, that's for sure.

145
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:43,400
Maybe you will get other eager helpers.

146
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:45,440
I'm snotty.

147
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:47,440
Necessarily.

148
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:49,440
Nipsu, Will you help?

149
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:51,440
Yeah, but I want something too.

150
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:53,440
Well, you can borrow wings.

151
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:57,440
I don't want to break them, I'm too heavy.

152
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:01,440
Don't worry, I'll try to figure something out.

153
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:06,440
Something nice, oh I'll be happy to help.

154
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:09,440
Nipsu, you ooze goodness.

155
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:18,440
You will definitely need the help of an expert when building a shed.

156
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:30,440
We're already deep enough.

157
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:37,440
No, we Moomins build thoroughly and I like the cement ready.

158
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:39,440
Clear.

159
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:45,440
Talk.

160
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:58,440
I've been thinking about it.

161
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:02,440
You will get one of my worthless machine building books.

162
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:04,440
A book?

163
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:06,440
And you don't want to?

164
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:09,440
If you happen to have anything else.

165
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:13,480
Would you like my worthless fountain pen?

166
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:15,480
I don't write much.

167
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:17,480
What about worthless?

168
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:20,480
Would there be something that is not worthless?

169
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:23,480
Aha, a gold coin.

170
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:26,480
Wow, that sounds like something.

171
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:29,480
Oh, boys, a real gold coin.

172
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:42,480
You are digging a really deep hole.

173
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:45,480
Stop and come eat bread and butter.

174
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:47,480
In the middle of everything.

175
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:48,480
So?

176
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:50,480
Maybe the depth of montu is enough.

177
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:53,480
Your brother and Nipsu are in the forest.

178
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:55,480
I know.

179
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:57,520
Hello, Miss Nisku.

180
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:01,520
Aah.

181
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:04,520
Hi, I have a question.

182
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:06,520
Then ask.

183
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:10,520
Is it true that your brother gave you a Moomin?

184
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:12,520
And, and, and.

185
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:16,520
Is it true that your brother gave you a Moomin?

186
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:18,520
In.

187
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:21,520
Sivet Moomin is nice.

188
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:23,560
Then ask.

189
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:27,560
Is it true that your brother gave the Moomins the boobies?

190
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:31,560
There is. Moominpiikko helps build the shed as a guest.

191
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:35,560
Didn't the straws break in the rush?

192
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:37,560
My brother is fixing them right now.

193
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:40,560
You know, I'll take him lunch.

194
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:43,560
Can your brother fix civets?

195
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:46,560
He can fix just about anything.

196
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:49,600
You need an awful lot of wood.

197
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:53,600
The shed has to be much bigger than the flywheel.

198
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:57,600
Moomin and Papa Moomin are digging a deep hole.

199
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:01,600
Everyone is so kind and helpful.

200
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:07,600
I don't think it's time to go get some nails.

201
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:09,600
Excellent!

202
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:13,600
Write him a note about other supplies.

203
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:17,640
Yes dear brother, you are so planful.

204
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:21,640
Famous inventors must be.

205
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:33,640
The aircraft shelter was completed in record time.

206
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:37,640
Whether it was due to Niisku's design skills or the fact that

207
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:42,640
that almost everyone in Moomin Valley lent a helping hand to Niisku.

208
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:45,640
Thanks.

209
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:47,640
Thanks.

210
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:49,640
Thanks.

211
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:51,640
Thanks.

212
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:53,640
Thanks.

213
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:55,640
Thanks.

214
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:57,640
Thanks.

215
00:14:57,640 --> 00:14:59,640
Thanks.

216
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:01,640
Thanks.

217
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:03,640
Thanks.

218
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:05,640
Thanks.

219
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:07,640
Thanks.

220
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:09,640
Thanks.

221
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:11,640
Thanks.

222
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:13,640
Thanks.

223
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:15,640
Thanks.

224
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:17,640
Thanks.

225
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:19,640
Thanks.

226
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:21,640
Thanks.

227
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:23,640
Thanks.

228
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:25,640
Thanks.

229
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:27,640
Thanks.

230
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:29,640
Thanks.

231
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:31,640
Thanks.

232
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:33,640
Thanks.

233
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:35,640
Thanks.

234
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:37,640
Thanks.

235
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:40,640
Ugh, building the shed was fun.

236
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:44,640
I have slightly changed the model of the wings.

237
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:48,640
Now it's easier to take off and land.

238
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:51,640
It is more convenient to turn the wings.

239
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:56,640
Thanks. I can hardly sleep next night because of the excitement.

240
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:58,640
When will you try the wings?

241
00:15:58,640 --> 00:15:59,640
Tomorrow.

242
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:01,640
Be careful.

243
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:05,640
Practice close to the ground before going higher.

244
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:09,640
I would feel terrible if something happened.

245
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:11,640
All right.

246
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:19,640
Where are you going to practice tomorrow?

247
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:21,640
I don't know yet.

248
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:28,640
Right on that little hillock, near the cliff.

249
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:32,640
Good, it's not dangerous. See you there.

250
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:38,640
Good.

251
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:09,640
Hello. I don't see wings.

252
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:13,640
If you came through Kust's door, you couldn't help but see them.

253
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:16,640
They are on the table.

254
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:20,640
On the table? There was nothing.

255
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:22,640
There was nothing.

256
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:24,640
There was nothing.

257
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:26,640
There was nothing.

258
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:28,640
There was nothing.

259
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:30,640
There was nothing.

260
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:32,640
There was nothing.

261
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:34,640
On the table.

262
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:36,640
There was nothing.

263
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:40,640
Hey.

264
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:45,640
You are right. My wings are gone.

265
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:47,640
Of course I'm right.

266
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:49,640
What could have happened to them?

267
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:51,640
Someone has walked them.

268
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:54,640
What's wrong with you two?

269
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:57,640
Someone has walked on Moomin's wings.

270
00:17:57,640 --> 00:18:00,640
Maybe they haven't really been stolen.

271
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:05,640
It is. And I do know who took them.

272
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:08,640
Where do we start looking for wings?

273
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:17,640
AI Suri.

274
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:20,640
You again. It didn't last long.

275
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:24,640
Aisuli, wait. The wings are mine.

276
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:27,640
I knew you walked them.

277
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:30,640
Abomination in that too.

278
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:32,640
Don't think so.

279
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:34,640
Let's wait.

280
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:37,640
I'll let you borrow the wings later.

281
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:41,640
No, no. I need wings to accelerate my career.

282
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:44,640
Varu's Moomin brat.

283
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:52,640
No.

284
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:54,640
Iti covers that too.

285
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:58,640
With the help of wings, I become a vestari criminal.

286
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:03,640
Aisuli is a vile scoundrel.

287
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:06,640
You shouldn't have left the wings out.

288
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:09,640
Who would have thought that Aisuli would steal from us.

289
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:13,640
We are his friends. Or at least almost.

290
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:15,640
But my coin was saved.

291
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:17,640
Don't mourn Moomin.

292
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:19,640
We still get wings.

293
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:22,640
I give Aisul a muzzle.

294
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:28,640
Aisuli drifts into the sea.

295
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:31,640
What is this?

296
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:33,640
I'll go out of harm's way.

297
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:35,640
Aisuli didn't know how to handle wings.

298
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:38,640
And drifted farther and farther.

299
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:40,640
AI Suri.

300
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:56,640
I just had to take a bath.

301
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:58,640
I guess the wings went sour.

302
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:01,640
Niisku builds new wings for you.

303
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:03,640
Aisul's mokoma.

304
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:10,640
AI Suri.
