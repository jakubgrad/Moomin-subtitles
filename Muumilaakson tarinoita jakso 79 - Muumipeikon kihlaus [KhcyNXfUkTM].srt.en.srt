1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:30,000
This is the kind of thing where other people say that other people say that other people say that other people say that other people say that other people say that other people say that other people say that other people say that other people say that other people say that the other says that the other says that the other says that the other says that the other says that the other says that the other says that the other says that the other says that the other says that the other says that the other says that the other says that the other says that the other says that the other says that the other says that the other says that the other says

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
that the other tells, that the other tells, the other tells.

3
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Hurry up!

4
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Huh? Why don't you thread it yourself?

5
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Oh goblin, you're not a romantic at all.

6
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Give it here. Reach out.

7
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Slip the ring gently on my finger.

8
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Anonymous? Now.

9
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Ankeksi.

10
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
The ring must be threaded gently and solemnly.

11
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Why?

12
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Because this is a significant moment in a teenager's life.

13
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Well, if you say so.

14
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:38,000
You should say this. Niiskunmi, do you want to wear this ring on your finger forever?

15
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
What if the owner of the ring comes?

16
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Tasteless Peikko!

17
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:48,000
All right. Niiskunmi, do you want to wear this ring on your finger forever?

18
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Oh, oh. This came so suddenly.

19
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
What do you mean? You yourself told me to ask.

20
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Oh Moomin, I want, I want forever.

21
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Anonymous, yes.

22
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Did it come out right?

23
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Oh, I'm so happy.

24
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Oh, now we're engaged.

25
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Engaged?

26
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Or is Moomin engaged?

27
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Engaged.

28
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Excellent.

29
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Moompa, this is no laughing matter.

30
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Your son is about to get married.

31
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Might it be wise to try it in practice first?

32
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
What would be wise to try? I didn't hear.

33
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Grandma, you don't even know what happened.

34
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Something unusual.

35
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Shut up, I'll explain.

36
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Listen, Moomin is engaged.

37
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
He is going to get married.

38
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Or so, and with whom?

39
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Wait until you hear.

40
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Imagine, a rainy Eid.

41
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Niisku with Eid.

42
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
It's not that bad.

43
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
What do you say, honey?

44
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Our son is getting married.

45
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
That's really good news.

46
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Oh, I don't understand Moomins.

47
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Niiskun Eidi is fat and stupid and gullible.

48
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:29,000
He's on the water and syrupy and childish.

49
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:35,000
How can Moomin wish for a rainy Eid when I exist too?

50
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Good luck, Moomin and Niiskun Eiti.

51
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Niiskun Eiti, you are so beautiful today.

52
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Let's take good care of Moomin.

53
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Congratulations.

54
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Good luck.

55
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Niiskun Eiti, you look pretty.

56
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
I guess you'll make a really good wife?

57
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Yes, I will definitely be the best.

58
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Good luck.

59
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Niiskun Eiti, you look pretty.

60
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
I guess you'll make a really good wife?

61
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Yes, I will definitely be the best.

62
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Moomin, I would like to remind you that even the beautiful ones need careful care.

63
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,000
I'm trying to remember.

64
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Good luck to the young, bald guys.

65
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:35,000
This is a true landmark case in Mumilapso.

66
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
It is.

67
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Can't say anything else.

68
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:43,000
May the happiness of these young people flourish forever.

69
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Listen Niiskun Eiti.

70
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
So what?

71
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000
The whole thing is starting to make me a bit suspicious.

72
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Don't joke about being stupid.

73
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,000
I told you this is just a joke.

74
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,000
You're a joke at weddings now.

75
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,000
I had no idea it would get this big.

76
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Everyone knows it's a joke.

77
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Nobody takes this seriously.

78
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
No, no, no.

79
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Is that so?

80
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Oh, what a terrible day.

81
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,000
I'm just fine.

82
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,000
It was the last wedding game.

83
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
My dear husband.

84
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,000
You don't mean me.

85
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Honey you're catching a cold, here's a blanket.

86
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Don't, I can fetch a blanket myself if I'm cold.

87
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:03,000
And don't call me honey, that's ridiculous.

88
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
I am your wife.

89
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,000
I have to take care of you.

90
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
What? Is that game still going on?

91
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Of course.

92
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:16,000
You can't stop a fun and affectionate game like this right away.

93
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Oh no.

94
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Here you get a small piece.

95
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Thanks niskuneeti.

96
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Would you like another piece?

97
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
This tastes good.

98
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Ah, they are like husband and wife.

99
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,000
I could want a wife too.

100
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Hey, don't get me wrong.

101
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Our marriage is just a joke.

102
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Yes, I know that.

103
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
We know.

104
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Well my son, how does it feel to be married?

105
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Dad stops.

106
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Niskuneti may get confused.

107
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
And I don't get confused.

108
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
I'm enjoying this as much as the rest.

109
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Good, so.

110
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,000
I too have mostly enjoyed being married to my father.

111
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Or what?

112
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
And yeah yeah.

113
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Ha ha ha.

114
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Oh, I wish I had an apple.

115
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Mother!

116
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Mom brings ome...

117
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Will you take the apple?

118
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:42,000
What made you think I was in the mood for an apple right now?

119
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Wives sense such things.

120
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
It was good.

121
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Wait a minute.

122
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
I want to sit next to you.

123
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,000
When I finished it, you'll be more comfortable eating.

124
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,000
I can eat myself.

125
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
All right. Thanks.

126
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,000
You don't have to thank me all the time.

127
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,000
I am your wife. Does it taste good?

128
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
It tastes good.

129
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Good. I already went to make your bed.

130
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Oh, oh, thank you.

131
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Oh yeah, I brought you some clean pajamas.

132
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:17,000
If you are put to sleep, you can go to sleep as soon as you want.

133
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Thanks.

134
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Newly washed and ironed pajamas.

135
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Niskuneiti is an overdrive.

136
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Tastes good.

137
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:02,000
No crazier. This game has many good points.

138
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Is married life really like this?

139
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Today was a wonderful day.

140
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Moomin wasn't embarrassed at all.

141
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Aha, there.

142
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Ring.

143
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,000
The ring is way too big.

144
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Why does the little girl get ice rings and not me?

145
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,000
What is wrong with the law?

146
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Oh, the ring I gave to the little girl.

147
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:52,000
He has forgotten it.

148
00:10:55,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Aha, without a ring he can't pretend to be married.

149
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Good morning, Moomin. What are you doing?

150
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Not much of anything. Good morning, little lady.

151
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Did you sleep well?

152
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Oh, I thought I left my ring here.

153
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Curious thing.

154
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Have you seen it? What's wrong with you?

155
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Well, that ring.

156
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:31,000
It got stuck in my finger so I can't get it out.

157
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,000
I don't think the ring looks small at all.

158
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:41,000
No worries, all you need here is strength.

159
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Dare!

160
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Oh, sorry.

161
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,000
That's right, Moomin. What are we going to do?

162
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
It hurts.

163
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Dad.

164
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
The Moomin.

165
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Metal expands when heated.

166
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Maybe we can get the ring off if we heat it up first.

167
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,000
That's a great idea.

168
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Niskuneiti, will you come and help? Let's get hot water.

169
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Let's come.

170
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
I guess it's not too hot.

171
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Probably not.

172
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Does it burn?

173
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Oh, it burns.

174
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
are you a man

175
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Well, that's fine.

176
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Does it feel like the ring has gotten bigger?

177
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,000
I don't think so, dad. Rather the opposite.

178
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
The water is too hot.

179
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
My skin can't take it anymore.

180
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Miserable.

181
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
All limpsahten.

182
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Yes, the beginning is enough.

183
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
There's nothing wrong with you.

184
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Oh good unusual.

185
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Will the ring come off?

186
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Not the other way around, papa. Moomin's finger has gotten thicker.

187
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Tough shit.

188
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:56,000
There must be some way to help Moomin.

189
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Would cold water help?

190
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Well, of course.

191
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Objects shrink in the cold.

192
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,000
But we should get a mere finger cold.

193
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
What would such a substance be?

194
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Icing helps. I have ice cream.

195
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
A pinch.

196
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
I'll be right back.

197
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Take a little while longer. Try to think of something positive.

198
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
I'll try.

199
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,000
So much trouble for one ring. Ha!

200
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
I would say something else.

201
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Hey, here comes the ice cream.

202
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Moomin's Nipsu came suddenly before it melts.

203
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:40,000
This is where I come from as far as I can get off my feet.

204
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Speed, speed.

205
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Let's come. Thanks, bud.

206
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Cool your fingers here.

207
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
It feels good.

208
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
I tell you what.

209
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Well, does icing help?

210
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Either way, that's enough.

211
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Not yet.

212
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Nipsu, you can't.

213
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
I have melted away.

214
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
The finger is already cold now.

215
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Oh! The ring went off.

216
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
So it seems.

217
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
I am free!

218
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Yay! Moomin!

219
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
I am so happy.

220
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Nipskuneiti!

221
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
What to do with the ring?

222
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Give it to me.

223
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Now we can pretend we're married again.

224
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Huh? Do you want to continue?

225
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Don't you?

226
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
When I don't...

227
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Do you think you don't love me anymore?

228
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Well, not quite that.

229
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Are you trying to say I've been a good wife?

230
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
No, that's not what I mean.

231
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
You don't like me!

232
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
I didn't say that.

233
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
You said it above.

234
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Well, I certainly didn't say.

235
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:51,000
That I had to find that Mokoma ring.

236
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Oh guys, what would it be like to live really married to a trinket girl?

237
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Snuff, would you like to get married?

238
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Have you ever wondered?

239
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:08,000
I can't answer that.

240
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,000
So you're going to stay a bachelor, aren't you?

241
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
What? Yeah, I guess.

242
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:16,000
I've finally settled into the marriage game.

243
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,000
I'm going to go on a short hike tomorrow.

244
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Would you like to come along?

245
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Of course I want to.

246
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:30,000
What's wrong mom? What are you watching?

247
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:34,000
And the Moomin trinkets seem to be at odds.

248
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Nipskuneitt, I'm trying to understand now.

249
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:43,000
I am a man and I must not be shackled or pampered.

250
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:47,000
I need adventure and danger and adversity.

251
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
To be happy.

252
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
That's why I have to leave.

253
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Your words make me sad.

254
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,000
But it doesn't matter if that's what you want.

255
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Thanks. I'm glad you understand me.

256
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,000
Moomin, are you coming back in the evening already?

257
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Not so loud.

258
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Moomin!

259
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
Hear it.

260
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Moomin!

261
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Goodbye my love.

262
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,000
It's fun to go on a trip with you.

263
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:30,000
But you have way too much equipment.

264
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Well, of course.

265
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
I understand.

266
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:37,000
But I'm glad I don't have to carry your backpack.

267
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Moomin!

268
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Moomin!

269
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Moomin!

270
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Moomin!

271
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Moomin!

272
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Moomin!

273
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
Moomin!

274
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
Are you sure you can go along?

275
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
Of course.

276
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
Wait a minute.

277
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:12,000
I'll leave some of the stuff here.

278
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Let's see.

279
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
Horizontal.

280
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,000
At least I don't need that on a trip.

281
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
And then the radio.

282
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
For weather reports.

283
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
More fun to be surprised in the morning.

284
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:30,000
I don't think you need a cake pan either.

285
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
And not all these pans.

286
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Oh, as a harpoon for pirates.

287
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
But maybe it's not needed.

288
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Sorry to keep you waiting.

289
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:43,000
It feels much lighter now.

290
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
Let's set up camp.

291
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
Then let's watch the sunset.

292
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Okay, I'm done.

293
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
Just the sunset.

294
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
Don't get emotional.

295
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
First we do the work.

296
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
Help tighten the strings.

297
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:00,000
Uh, let me sit down for a second first.

298
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
The sun is setting fast.

299
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
We still have to stay the sunset.

300
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
Don't get emotional.

301
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
First we do the work.

302
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Help tighten the strings.

303
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
Uh, let me sit down for a second first.

304
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
We still have to stay the sunset.

305
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Just like that.

306
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
How do you feel?

307
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Did you enjoy the trip?

308
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
Oh, I enjoyed it very much.

309
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Are you absolutely sure about that?

310
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
Of course I am.

311
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
But it's really tiring.

312
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
No wonder the first day.

313
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
Hi, do you have anything?

314
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
Yeah, a really big one.

315
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
And I don't eat fish at all.

316
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
Well, that's enough.

317
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
I can't eat more than this.

318
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
Are you leaving?

319
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
Try to get a few cents.

320
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
The rip is just beginning.

321
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
There is no shortage of time.

322
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
I caught fish!

323
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
I caught fish!

324
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
Look at this!

325
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
Awesome catch.

326
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
Yes, but smaller than your fish.

327
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
But they are your own fishing rods.

328
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
That's all that matters.

329
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
Let's say.

330
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
Sit down to eat.

331
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
Thanks, how about you?

332
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
I have already started here.

333
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
Oh guys I'm hungry.

334
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:34,000
They say that when you're on a trip, you have to get your own food.

335
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
That's what we've done with you.

336
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
We're leaving early.

337
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
Come to the tent after you have eaten.

338
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
Genuine.

339
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
Well, let's go.

340
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
Beg a little!

341
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
Mother!

342
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
Wake up!

343
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
Hello, you snuffling!

344
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
What's wrong now?

345
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
Look over there!

346
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
The stuff I took out of the backpack.

347
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
Oops, well then I've lost my way.

348
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:46,000
And we have come back the same way.

349
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
We could turn around.

350
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
I wouldn't go astray anymore.

351
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
We won't turn around.

352
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
Niskuneit!

353
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
I already came!

354
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
Moomin!

355
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
Did he come back from a trip?

356
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:06,000
Mom, that marriage game is a lot more fun than hiking.

357
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
Marriage game?

358
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
Oh, that's old stuff.

359
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
Is it?

360
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
Hey, let's play football!

361
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
I want worlds.

362
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
Please!

363
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
Please!
