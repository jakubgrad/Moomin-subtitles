1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Hey, hey, hey!

2
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
News! Big news!

3
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Big news, come check it out!

4
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Say, what's the matter?

5
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
A prophet has appeared in Grandma's lakso!

6
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
A prophet?

7
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
He is so wonderful, so wonderful!

8
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Who's here?

9
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
I want to see.

10
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
I want to see.

11
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I want to see.

12
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
I want to see.

13
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
I want to see.

14
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Who is this prophet?

15
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
What the hell is a prophet doing here?

16
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Come and see, and you'll see!

17
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Come and see, and you'll see!

18
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I'm very hungry.

19
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I'm very hungry.

20
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I'm very hungry.

21
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I'm in a hurry, it's going to be a big party!

22
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Party!

23
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Or big dinners?

24
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Dear friends, it's time for a change.

25
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:42,000
I have come here to help you change your life.

26
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Dear friends, go back to nature and live a free life.

27
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Back to nature!

28
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Back to nature!

29
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
And be true to yourself!

30
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Where are the eateries?

31
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Shut up and listen!

32
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Only freedom leads to happiness!

33
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Isn't it great?

34
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Splendid?

35
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
A prophet.

36
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Where do we eat?

37
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
He makes everyone happy.

38
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
I get happy just looking at him.

39
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,000
I have come to bring you happiness!

40
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:21,000
You are prisoners of your habits and narrow views.

41
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Shake off your old clothes and put on something new.

42
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Put on your freedom.

43
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
I guess he's a tailor.

44
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
He is a prophet and that's cool.

45
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Good people, be happy!

46
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Shake your worries off your shoulders and be free.

47
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Aren't we free?

48
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:48,000
I have always imagined in my mind that we are free.

49
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Maybe I'm wrong.

50
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Whatever you do, be happy.

51
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
That must be right.

52
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:01,000
The most important thing is to be happy.

53
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
The prophet is right.

54
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Let's throw our shackles away.

55
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Back to freedom!

56
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Back to freedom!

57
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000
I hear you go go!

58
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
I want a new life too.

59
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
I didn't know before that I'm not free.

60
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Freedom and happy!

61
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Dad, what are you building?

62
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,000
I'm moving to live in this tree.

63
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Don't you live with us anymore?

64
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
I really don't.

65
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
I return to nature and I am free.

66
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
I don't even feel bad about myself.

67
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Sun and wind.

68
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Bark and leaf crunch.

69
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Then!

70
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Dude, what are you doing?

71
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
I do the work.

72
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
What work do you do?

73
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Fresh juice only.

74
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Only? Oh fresh juice only?

75
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,000
This is real freedom juice.

76
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:38,000
The juice has a very refreshing effect, when you drink it you feel free.

77
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:43,000
If the juice sells well, I would make a lot of money and be happy.

78
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
I simply call this lucky juice.

79
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:50,000
To me it looks like regular fruit juice.

80
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
But it isn't.

81
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:56,000
When you're thirsty and you drink it, you instantly become much much happier.

82
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Mahdankohan?

83
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
I'll prove it to you.

84
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
I drink this miracle juice myself.

85
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
I'm thirsty.

86
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,000
The scent of nature and freedom.

87
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Oh my guts probably went to waste.

88
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Did the juice really taste that awful?

89
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:32,000
The rowan berries became bitter, but when the taste passes, Aromio's blissful.

90
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
I didn't become happy.

91
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Moomin-Pekko, it's your turn to taste.

92
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
I don't want to.

93
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,000
I'll taste now and say what ingredients I need to add.

94
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Please.

95
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
I try to find happiness in another way.

96
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Hey, just a quickie.

97
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Poison. Pepper.

98
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Listen mom.

99
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
So what?

100
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Father has moved to live in a tree and Nipsu prepares happiness juice to become rich.

101
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Is it freedom?

102
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Oh well.

103
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Is it lucky juice?

104
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Is it lucky juice?

105
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Is it lucky juice?

106
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Oh well.

107
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Maybe freedom is that everyone gets to do exactly what they want.

108
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:35,000
In my opinion, I have always done what I want.

109
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,000
The drug mom is right.

110
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:45,000
So that it is also freedom when you eat and sleep when you want.

111
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
I guess so.

112
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,000
But it's difficult for a watch.

113
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Is dad happy in his nest in the tree?

114
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Well, maybe you're not always happy even when you're free.

115
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Freedom can be surprisingly complicated.

116
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Moominpappa probably notices how difficult it is to work in wood

117
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:08,000
and before he gets a cup of coffee in there, it has time to freeze.

118
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,000
The freedom fighters are pissed off.

119
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Hey nipskuneites.

120
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Hello Moomin.

121
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Where are you going?

122
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Look what I'm wearing.

123
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:30,000
What do you think of the new freedom dress, will it suit me?

124
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
It's unusual.

125
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,000
So what do I look like?

126
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
How so?

127
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Oh you guys, can't you see that I have a new hairstyle?

128
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:45,000
I'm leaving here now to look for a new life of freedom.

129
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
So do I.

130
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:51,000
I fall in love with a nice man and live a new life with him.

131
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
So do I.

132
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
What the hell new life?

133
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Oh Moomin, you should look for a new life too.

134
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Bye.

135
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
So trinket lady!

136
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Well what are your feelings?

137
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,000
So, towards Nipskunei.

138
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
I don't give a damn about him.

139
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Hey, wait, pretty girl!

140
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,000
I am the most beautiful creature I have ever seen.

141
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:27,000
The time of freedom has now come, and I cannot live without you.

142
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
If you become my own, then I will love only you.

143
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
For sure.

144
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
I worship the ground you tread on.

145
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,000
I'll follow your heels like a shadow.

146
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,000
That sounded pretty good.

147
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Will you even go through the fire for me?

148
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Of course, if it doesn't burn.

149
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:49,000
I will carry you in my arms through the storms of life.

150
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,000
I'm not as light as I look.

151
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Freedom of life.

152
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:58,000
You cook for me and then we are happy.

153
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Now I know, I'll rob you.

154
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Are you robbing?

155
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,000
We plunge across the sea and look for a new home.

156
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Sounds wonderful.

157
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Malta can hardly wait to see what comes next.

158
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Hei Boomipeikko.

159
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Do you want to know one thing?

160
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
I don't believe in skunks.

161
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,000
I want to know one thing.

162
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
I want to know one thing.

163
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
I want to know one thing.

164
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
I want to know one thing.

165
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
I don't believe in skunks.

166
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,000
That matter concerns the marshmallow lady.

167
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,000
What do you know about wetlands?

168
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Would I tell you that.

169
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,000
What is that thing? Say it already.

170
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Niiskunnei has a fiancé and they intend to elope.

171
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
I'm going to miss Niskunnei.

172
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
I won't miss you.

173
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Right? A young couple sails on the sea.

174
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:10,000
When you sail, now we live in a time of freedom.

175
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Come on.

176
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:18,000
If they do what they want, you do what you want anyway.

177
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
You're a man, aren't you?

178
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
What do you mean by that?

179
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:26,000
If something is stolen from you, you take it back.

180
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Hit that man, it's cute, right?

181
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
You could be right.

182
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:36,000
I am free and can do what I want.

183
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
A real man's speech.

184
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:42,000
I can be freer than anyone else in the whole world.

185
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Of course you can be a Moomin, Goblin.

186
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
A good fight is invigorating.

187
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Well, are we going to leave soon?

188
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,000
I don't want to just look at the ocean.

189
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:12,000
I do need some time to think.

190
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Crooked, seducer of innocence.

191
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
I'm a black hand.

192
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Lady, I will investigate for you.

193
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Can you trust that man?

194
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Mustakaus and our underling are just talking.

195
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Take your sword and fight for your woman.

196
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Take your sword hand, you coward too.

197
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
What's wrong with you?

198
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
And you have not gone to fight for me?

199
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Well, when I'm scared.

200
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Let's get started then.

201
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:28,000
I just forgot that I have an appointment soon.

202
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,000
If only tomorrow.

203
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
How crazy.

204
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Would a domineering man run away from you?

205
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:51,000
The lucky lady, the black hand is glad that you can help.

206
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Makomak's pirate.

207
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Maybe you think you're funny?

208
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:01,000
I didn't believe that man, even though he spoke nice things to me.

209
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,000
I showed that boy, didn't I?

210
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,000
I wouldn't have wanted that.

211
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
That's right miss.

212
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
I'm dying of laughter.

213
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
It looks like it's going to rain heavily.

214
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Honey, would you like an umbrella?

215
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Would you like an umbrella?

216
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Oh, thanks.

217
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Wait, no thanks.

218
00:13:55,000 --> 00:14:00,000
If it rains I get wet, that's perfectly natural.

219
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Honey, do you really find it fun to live in a tree?

220
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Certain. Here I can feel completely free.

221
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:14,000
To be free and happy like a bird in the sky.

222
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
I can see that you are enjoying yourself.

223
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
That he just catches a cold.

224
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Moominpa Ressu.

225
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:45,000
He is too stubborn and proud to give in.

226
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,000
But daddy will come back.

227
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Papa doesn't enjoy himself for too long on one thing.

228
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:19,000
I believe papa will soon tire of freedom.

229
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:39,000
I should probably go weed the garden.

230
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:42,000
It's been a long time since the last time.

231
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:46,000
Firewood would have to be chopped and the pipe snuffed.

232
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:50,000
And the porch floor would be pretty dirty.

233
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Everyone is so busy living a free life.

234
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:01,000
What if I tried freedom too?

235
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,000
It can be fun.

236
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
I'm very hungry.

237
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Father!

238
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
What now, Moomin?

239
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Father, I want to speak with you among men.

240
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,000
I have tried to live a free life.

241
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Nothing really comes of it.

242
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:35,000
I want to be free and happy just like you.

243
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Well, listen, Moomin.

244
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,000
See, the thing is...

245
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
Dad, are you okay?

246
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Can you bring me another blanket?

247
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
It's fine.

248
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Oh, oh, it takes a lot of everything to live a free life.

249
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:06,000
Should have asked to bring food too.

250
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
Father! Father!

251
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:12,000
Now we're in trouble, you're reading this!

252
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,000
Well, what's the matter, my son?

253
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:19,000
Dear family, dinner is ready.

254
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Warm it up in the oven when you get home.

255
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:29,000
You can find raspberry jam on the top left shelf and in the aspirin spoon drawer.

256
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Best regards, Moomin.

257
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:37,000
But mother can't start living a free life, right?

258
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
This becomes a problem.

259
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
He didn't hurt you.

260
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Oh my, I'm getting too old for this.

261
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:52,000
He immediately went to look for his mother.

262
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,000
Clear!

263
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Mother!

264
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
Mother!

265
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
Mother!

266
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,000
Mamma!

267
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Mamma!

268
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,000
Sweetheart!

269
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
It's not even in the vegetable garden.

270
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,000
Mother!

271
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Mother!

272
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
What's wrong now?

273
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,000
Oh, aitee!

274
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
What are you doing here in the middle of the night?

275
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
Have you seen mother?

276
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:41,000
We are not, we come this late from the prophet.

277
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
Did you go see him yet?

278
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:49,000
We went to ask what free life is like at its best, but he had already left.

279
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:53,000
It is because of that new prophet that mother has left home.

280
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
I don't think it helps, it's terrible!

281
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Mother!

282
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
Mummy Moomin!

283
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
Mamma!

284
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:12,000
Where are you, Moominma?

285
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
Which one is he in?

286
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
Where has he gone?

287
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,000
Mother!

288
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
Mummy Moomin!

289
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
Mother!

290
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:32,000
Why did Moominma leave us?

291
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:36,000
How can Moomin imagine that we will survive without her?

292
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,000
If we don't make it, that's fine with us.

293
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
What do you mean by that?

294
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:44,000
We tried freedom on your initiative.

295
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:48,000
My? Isn't that idiot prophet behind it all?

296
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,000
Moomin is probably right.

297
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:57,000
I feel like Moomin got tired of us and our new free life.

298
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
That's why he left home.

299
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
Oh you! My corner window!

300
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,000
Why are you coming so late?

301
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:16,000
I have news about Moomin.

302
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
Right from home!

303
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,000
Mother!

304
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:29,000
Do not! I don't want to wake up my mother.

305
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:35,000
Moominma wanted to borrow my tent, so she could have some time in peace.

306
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:38,000
Shouldn't you be at home in peace?

307
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:43,000
Apparently, Moominma wants to sleep in a tent again sometimes.

308
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:46,000
Well, at least he scared us once.

309
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:50,000
Hey, aren't we all going home to sleep under the covers?

310
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:54,000
We'll come again in the morning to pick up Moomin.

311
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
Okay, I'm getting tired.

312
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,000
My corner cabin, you can stay with us for the night.

313
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:02,000
Oh, thanks Moominpapa.

314
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
Thanks.

315
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
Thanks.
