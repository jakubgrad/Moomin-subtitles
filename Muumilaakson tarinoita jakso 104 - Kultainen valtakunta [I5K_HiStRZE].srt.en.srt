1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
No, what's going on now? Help, help, help, help!

2
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
How did you do?

3
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Not how, but...

4
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Then help me!

5
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Love broke!

6
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Time machine!

7
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Niskuneti sells! Did it hurt?

8
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Plastic knife! Hey look!

9
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Well, that's awful! The star turns black!

10
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Oh no, then it won't help Jennit채t anymore.

11
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Maybe the star only twinkles in cold places.

12
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,000
So it is not the medicine that Jennit채ti meant.

13
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Phooey.

14
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:36,000
We must try to find the twinkling medicine that the star needs.

15
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
I don't care to search anymore!

16
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
We're leaving!

17
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
I'm hungry.

18
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Awaiting heat!

19
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
What place is this?

20
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
We had to come to Moominvalley.

21
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Not that little sense of yours!

22
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
When has Moomin Valley been in the jungle?

23
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Hello Moomin! Let's go home already.

24
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:06,000
No way. We can't leave until we find Jennit채t's medicine.

25
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Wow! Why did you stop?

26
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
I saw something shiny!

27
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I love anything that sparkles!

28
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Hey!

29
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Alligator!

30
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Hello! Don't eat me!

31
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
I have bad taste! I am, I am!

32
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Wait, Beast!

33
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
I'll take care of this!

34
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Mii!

35
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
A pinch! You don't have to fear anymore!

36
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
I trust you sell!

37
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Now! Then let's start fighting!

38
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,000
You won't bite us with those dirty teeth of yours!

39
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Mee! It's serious!

40
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Bite this stick!

41
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
It has strong teeth!

42
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
You can be wise in the back!

43
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Haa!

44
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Hello Alligator! A pinch is a much bigger bite!

45
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
I don't!

46
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Are!

47
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
I'm small and toxic!

48
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Just be you!

49
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Sell and Pinch! Come here!

50
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Humi, Troll and Ladybug!

51
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
I'm jumping!

52
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
I guess it won't sink!

53
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Hurry up!

54
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Jump here!

55
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
But when I can't swim!

56
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
You have no choice!

57
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Oh God! Oh God! Oh God!

58
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
I see! Try to catch us!

59
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Oh no! It goes after!

60
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
That's where it comes from!

61
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Good luck!

62
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Try to take it!

63
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Moomin, Goblin and Nipsu are scary!

64
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Faster! Faster!

65
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Hurry up!

66
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
It catches us!

67
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Help! Help! We sink to the bottom!

68
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
And I can't swim!

69
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Don't always be a joke, Janis Housu!

70
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Oops! What happened now?

71
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
I think we were saved!

72
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Hi! Come here on the ferry!

73
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Oh, thanks a lot!

74
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Which machine would work?

75
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Otherwise we're in trouble!

76
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
And we'll never get home!

77
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
It's a time machine!

78
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Let's hope!

79
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Let's hope and hope!

80
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
We'll see if we try!

81
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Is it a modern sculpture?

82
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Absolutely not! This is a time machine and our valuable property!

83
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:35,000
A combination of a watch and an onfel machine equipped with an umbrella.

84
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,000
We can't go home without a time machine.

85
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Yeah. I'm not interested in new things.

86
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Only old things are beautiful.

87
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
He is a pleasant gentleman.

88
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
What are you doing here in the jungle?

89
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Oh what?

90
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
What do I look like?

91
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Very suspicious!

92
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Did you see?

93
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Wedding! The golden fish!

94
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
It flashed beautifully!

95
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Good! The golden kingdom is near!

96
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
A golden kingdom?

97
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Right! Finding the Golden Kingdom is my lifelong dream!

98
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000
No! Explorer!

99
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Well, what is there in the golden kingdom?

100
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,000
There rises the palace of stars at the top!

101
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,000
There are tears of the sun and the moon!

102
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,000
There are star drops!

103
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Drops of stars!

104
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
How romantic!

105
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
It sure is beautiful.

106
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
You could find a sale there!

107
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
You just wanted to go to the palace.

108
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
It's a trifle after everything else!

109
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Maybe we will find Jennit채n's medicine in the golden kingdom.

110
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Hey explorer, can we join?

111
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,000
There is always company for those traveling alone!

112
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Hey!

113
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
What is it?

114
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,000
It must be the gate of the golden kingdom!

115
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Hold tight!

116
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Hey!

117
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Terrible!

118
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Oh finally stop!

119
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
We survived.

120
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
What do we do now?

121
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Let's go forward on foot.

122
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
This seems like a dead end.

123
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
There could be a palace wall there.

124
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
The sun and moon of the stars!

125
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:13,000
The Palace of Stars, the holiest place in the Golden Kingdom begins here!

126
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
How do we get in?

127
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Where is the palace door?

128
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Oh, sails!

129
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Why do those characters look so angry?

130
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Because their purpose is to keep intruders away.

131
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Aha, just scaremongering.

132
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
You don't scare me!

133
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:38,000
You can't go after like an alligator!

134
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Come on! Run away!

135
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
What did you want?

136
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Hey, leave me alone!

137
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Help!

138
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Stupid sweeper, get your nails off me! What exactly are you going to do? Help!

139
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Help!

140
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Was a loud and argumentative creature.

141
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,000
But on the inside, he's definitely kind and affectionate.

142
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
We are not to be taken back!

143
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:28,000
We have to get to the other side of the wall so we can save him.

144
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Where are you taking me?

145
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:35,000
I will not be food for your chicks! You get to see!

146
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Did you still want to keep me in the air?

147
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Too high. No dice.

148
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
So.

149
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,000
That you could look for an open door?

150
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Oh, did you get hurt badly?

151
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Curious thing. It was moving.

152
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
The wall opened!

153
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
I push in!

154
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Wait!

155
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Let me down! Still wanted to play with me?

156
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Teach! Don't try to peck!

157
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,000
If you don't believe me, I'll wring your neck out!

158
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
I'm not to be played with!

159
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
where are you

160
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Where exactly are you all?

161
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Movie-Veikko!

162
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
A pinch!

163
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
how are you there

164
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:57,000
We must have gotten lost here. This is a labyrinth.

165
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Oh, I guess not.

166
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,000
How dare you bite me in the rear!

167
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Apologize immediately!

168
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Because you won't let me fuck you!

169
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Do not! Do not!

170
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Oh, after all, the soul gold remained!

171
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Sell, where are you?

172
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
The same condor that caught Myy.

173
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Since Mytta is nowhere to be seen, it has already swallowed him.

174
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
And not!

175
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
The condor flew that way!

176
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Let's go there!

177
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:11,000
These dogs are set to guard the doorway.

178
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Now join us to open the door to history!

179
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Hey, we had to save the little shop.

180
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
How do you open that door?

181
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Would that statue move too?

182
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Too scary.

183
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
I'm looking into this.

184
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Nipsu, can you find anything?

185
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,000
There's something in this dog's mouth!

186
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
What now?

187
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
No sweat.

188
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
What's in this mouth?

189
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
I'm afraid I'm getting wet!

190
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,000
The palace I've always dreamed of!

191
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Now I found it!

192
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
This is the fulfillment of my life!

193
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Poke us!

194
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Hey, listen!

195
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Yes, that voice!

196
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
It must be.

197
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,000
You go home and leave me hanging here!

198
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
You are fine!

199
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:26,000
All the blood has gone to the head since you took so long!

200
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
You didn't hurt yourself!

201
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Help me down now!

202
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Sorry!

203
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
You can get out right away!

204
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:40,000
I was afraid that Kondor had already poked you in the cheek.

205
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Haha, that kind of old scum won't eat me!

206
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
I bit it!

207
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
I'm so glad you played!

208
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Shit, stop it!

209
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:54,000
You and I, we don't care about each other!

210
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Hi, hi, hi, hi!

211
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Oh this happiness!

212
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
This is pure gold!

213
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Look!

214
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Of course it's gold!

215
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
It looks even stupider now!

216
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Wow! There's Diamond!

217
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Maybe a real Diamond!

218
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Maybe it's a ruby!

219
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Diamond is colorless!

220
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
And that blue is Safiri!

221
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Amazing!

222
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Oh so beautiful!

223
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
I'm rich, I'm rich!

224
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
It is wonderful to own!

225
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
What was it?

226
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
I got a weird feeling!

227
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Come on, don't hang around there!

228
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Deafness out there, come out boldly!

229
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
No, no, don't come!

230
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Niskunnetti, don't be a joke!

231
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
What do you really want?

232
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
If you touch us with your paw,

233
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
I made you a fur coat!

234
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Who is that then?

235
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Who exactly are you?

236
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
You don't seem to be those greedy adventurers,

237
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
whose heads can only fit one thought.

238
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
I wish I had gold!

239
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Why have you come here?

240
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
We are looking for medicine for Jennit채t.

241
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Jennit채tti is in severe pain!

242
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Aunt Jenni, I feel familiar!

243
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
A long time ago, a couple came here,

244
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
and Ropva had such a big nose,

245
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
like you too.

246
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
They had lost their guide.

247
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Ah, so Aunt Jennit채ti has been here.

248
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
So what do you do?

249
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
I've been here.

250
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
I've been here.

251
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
I've been here.

252
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
I've been here.

253
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
So what are you doing here?

254
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
Me?

255
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
I am the gatekeeper of the palace.

256
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
I have been for five hundred years.

257
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
What?

258
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
Five hundred years, right?

259
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Or are you Jenni's relatives?

260
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Or are you Jenni's relatives?

261
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
Come on, go ahead.

262
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
Come on, go ahead.

263
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Are you sure that cat won't bite us?

264
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
Are you sure that cat won't bite us?

265
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
What here has fatter morsels of taste than you?

266
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
What here has fatter morsels of taste than you?

267
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
Don't hint!

268
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
At least I'm not fat.

269
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
At least I'm not fat.

270
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
Just like a winter sky!

271
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Just like a winter sky!

272
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
This is how the ancient peoples saw space.

273
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
This is how the ancient peoples saw space.

274
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Full of dreams!

275
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
This is so romantic.

276
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
This is so romantic.

277
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
I feel so good.

278
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
I feel so good.

279
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
We are in the middle of a fabulous nebula.

280
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
We are in the middle of a fabulous nebula.

281
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Serttainen Jenny was as excited about everything as you were,

282
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
Serttainen Jenny was as excited about everything as you were,

283
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
but he must have gotten awfully old already.

284
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
but he must have gotten awfully old already.

285
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
It is, and he suffers from a witch's arrow.

286
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
Go for it, right?

287
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
You're looking for that sparkler.

288
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Yeah, can we have it here?

289
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:24,700
Page allied?

290
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Are these all medicines?

291
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Oh!

292
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
What beautiful quilts there are here.

293
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
They are all generic drugs.

294
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
They are all generic drugs.

295
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Neule increased Libya Lagi

296
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
They can cure any disease

297
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
or end the pain in the bear.

298
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
There's that red, twinkling initial medicine.

299
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Haitzus dreaming!

300
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
Can I have a peek inside?

301
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,920
Yay! An acrid smell!

302
00:17:55,920 --> 00:18:01,800
Oh, oh, oh! Is the medicine so old that it has become invalid?

303
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:04,600
Oh! Is there another medicine?

304
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:09,040
It is the only medicine that takes away the pain. Unfortunately.

305
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:14,520
Or so. Then we must return to Jennitad empty-handed.

306
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:18,800
It was that twinkling medicine that could have made him well again.

307
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:20,800
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!

308
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Quiver moon

309
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,440
Where have the children gone?

310
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:38,080
Eat is mine. I shouldn't have told Moomin and his friends about the twinkling star medicine,

311
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:40,200
If only they were safe.

312
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:42,680
Oh, of course they are.

313
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:47,280
Oh! Hey!

314
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:49,000
Hello again!

315
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,880
Oh, praise!

316
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:52,880
It's fun to be home.

317
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:55,880
So there is a place that looks like a glimpse of the rest.

318
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:57,880
What a relief.

319
00:18:57,880 --> 00:19:01,880
I was very worried about you. Glad you made it home.

320
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:03,880
Grandma's medicine helped.

321
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:06,880
Auntie's witch's arrow has healed.

322
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:11,880
We found a flickering medicine, but it had already gotten old.

323
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:12,880
Sorry.

324
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:14,880
Don't do it, Surko.

325
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:18,880
And after all, we got to see many exciting things.

326
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:21,880
So much lovely sparkle and glitter.

327
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:23,880
Everything was in one piece.

328
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:27,880
You can hear about everything we saw on the way.

329
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:28,880
Thanks in advance.

330
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:32,880
And now we celebrate that Aunt Jenni has recovered.

331
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:35,880
Oops, because it has happened.

332
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:52,880
Hehehe, funny cures. Here, please.

333
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:53,880
Hi, hi.

334
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:57,880
Does Moomin mom need an entrepreneur for you?

335
00:19:57,880 --> 00:19:59,880
I hope you like star flower.

336
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:01,880
Oh, how kind.

337
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:06,880
I'll give you some stardust that I once found in the desert. Here.

338
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:08,880
Oh, oh, thank you.

339
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:11,880
For this reason I gathered from the sea.

340
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:13,880
Oh, thank you.

341
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:16,880
For this reason I gathered from the sea.

342
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:19,880
Oh, thank you. I thank you all.

343
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:25,880
Share, here's a little memory.

344
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:29,880
You shouldn't have taken them.

345
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:33,880
Thanks Nipsu, but I just keep them myself.

346
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:34,880
Oh right.

347
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:36,880
Hi, yes that's fine.

348
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:37,880
They are not you.

349
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:40,880
We keep them Christian, you know.

350
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:42,880
And no, no.

351
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:46,880
Nipsu, give me one gem.

352
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:58,880
Give me too.

353
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:00,880
And not.

354
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:15,880
Ha ha ha.
