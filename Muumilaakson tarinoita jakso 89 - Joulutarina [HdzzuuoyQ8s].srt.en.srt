1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:13,520
Lipsus, it fuer t skirt��asaam.

2
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:16,460
Do you think?

3
00:00:16,460 --> 00:00:19,240
To change?

4
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:22,480
Yeah yeah yeah

5
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:24,940
Miton Cute?

6
00:00:24,940 --> 00:00:27,460
TMacs.

7
00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:29,460
Let's come!

8
00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:33,820
Hooray, kids!

9
00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:37,620
Father!

10
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:40,020
Do I fire the rifle?

11
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:41,460
That would be fun.

12
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:43,700
We will get an official competition judge.

13
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:45,700
So it seems!

14
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:52,020
So, are you ready for some serious competition?

15
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:55,980
Settle down in the starting pits, ready in your places.

16
00:00:55,980 --> 00:00:57,980
Let's come!

17
00:01:02,980 --> 00:01:03,980
Father!

18
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:05,980
Moominpapa!

19
00:01:05,980 --> 00:01:08,980
Moominpappa needs to dig out!

20
00:01:08,980 --> 00:01:09,980
Joo.

21
00:01:09,980 --> 00:01:12,980
To make sure Moominpappa doesn't run out!

22
00:01:12,980 --> 00:01:15,980
Oops, the tail came out already!

23
00:01:15,980 --> 00:01:17,980
Kiscokaa!

24
00:01:20,980 --> 00:01:22,980
What is it?

25
00:01:22,980 --> 00:01:24,980
We pulled the wrong tail!

26
00:01:24,980 --> 00:01:26,980
Father!

27
00:01:26,980 --> 00:01:30,980
I did something stupid, if we're honest.

28
00:01:35,980 --> 00:01:38,980
Dad, you're doing great!

29
00:01:38,980 --> 00:01:40,980
In this law, you won't beat me yet!

30
00:01:40,980 --> 00:01:42,980
I don't, do I? Well, let's see!

31
00:01:42,980 --> 00:01:44,980
Well, I don't, Moomin!

32
00:01:44,980 --> 00:01:46,980
Oh, the postman!

33
00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:48,980
Dad, the postman is here!

34
00:01:48,980 --> 00:01:50,980
I have a book for you!

35
00:01:50,980 --> 00:01:53,980
I miss it, I don't have time to take it now!

36
00:01:53,980 --> 00:01:55,980
I'm racing up the hill!

37
00:01:56,980 --> 00:01:58,980
Hey, this won't last long!

38
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:03,980
I'll wait a bit now!

39
00:02:03,980 --> 00:02:05,980
Hey, you're coming strong!

40
00:02:05,980 --> 00:02:06,980
Let's compete!

41
00:02:06,980 --> 00:02:07,980
Don't go!

42
00:02:07,980 --> 00:02:09,980
Sorry!

43
00:02:09,980 --> 00:02:11,980
Will you join the competition?

44
00:02:11,980 --> 00:02:13,980
Then we went!

45
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:16,980
Well, it doesn't matter if I'm asked once!

46
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:21,980
We have tough guys at the post office!

47
00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:23,980
So am I!

48
00:02:23,980 --> 00:02:25,980
When he was young, he was a famous hillbilly man!

49
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:27,980
You definitely can't beat me!

50
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:28,980
Victory!

51
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:29,980
No way!

52
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:33,980
A decent race!

53
00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:35,980
You are childish!

54
00:02:35,980 --> 00:02:37,980
Turn old people into speed freaks!

55
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:40,980
Tuopuu can be a target command!

56
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:42,980
Here's how it goes!

57
00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:44,980
Wild!

58
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:50,980
Come on, I won this race!

59
00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:54,980
Hey, yes I finished a little early!

60
00:02:54,980 --> 00:02:55,980
You don't!

61
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:59,980
The tip of my left ski reached the finish line first!

62
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:02,980
Just like you have longer skis!

63
00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:03,980
It's not!

64
00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:04,980
Don't try!

65
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:05,980
I won!

66
00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:06,980
You don't!

67
00:03:06,980 --> 00:03:07,980
The most victorious!

68
00:03:09,980 --> 00:03:12,980
Otherwise, did you have any business?

69
00:03:12,980 --> 00:03:14,980
Oh yes, this letter!

70
00:03:15,980 --> 00:03:16,980
Thank you!

71
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:18,980
Who is it from?

72
00:03:18,980 --> 00:03:19,980
I won!

73
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:20,980
Was that clear?

74
00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:21,980
Sweet!

75
00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:24,980
Oh heaven!

76
00:03:24,980 --> 00:03:26,980
Who did you get the letter from?

77
00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:27,980
Well, from who?

78
00:03:27,980 --> 00:03:29,980
From Aunt Jenni!

79
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:30,980
From Aunt Jenni?

80
00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:32,980
From the bridge aunt!

81
00:03:39,980 --> 00:03:42,980
Well, what does Aunt Jennität write?

82
00:03:42,980 --> 00:03:44,980
Dad, open the letter already!

83
00:03:44,980 --> 00:03:46,980
Hurry now, grandma!

84
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:47,980
Read, read!

85
00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:49,980
Now don't get excited!

86
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:53,980
A charming postcard!

87
00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:54,980
Yes!

88
00:03:54,980 --> 00:03:55,980
Jennitädintalo!

89
00:03:55,980 --> 00:03:57,980
It is spacious and beautiful!

90
00:03:57,980 --> 00:04:01,980
Welcome to spend a few days at my place!

91
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:04,980
An excellent dinner awaits you!

92
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:08,980
Your young friends can come along even if they are noisy!

93
00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:09,980
Jennityi!

94
00:04:09,980 --> 00:04:11,980
It's a real invitation card!

95
00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:14,980
Hi, we're going to visit Jennitäd's read!

96
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:16,980
Yay!

97
00:04:16,980 --> 00:04:19,980
I've never been there before!

98
00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:24,980
Jennitäti is so rich that she can give us one or another nice thing!

99
00:04:24,980 --> 00:04:25,980
Wonder and wonder!

100
00:04:25,980 --> 00:04:28,980
For once you thought about something other than food!

101
00:04:28,980 --> 00:04:31,980
It might as well be food!

102
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:34,980
You have one cheerful character!

103
00:04:35,980 --> 00:04:36,980
Don't always bark!

104
00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:41,980
How should you react to Jennitäd's invitation?

105
00:04:41,980 --> 00:04:43,980
We welcome you!

106
00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:47,980
Sure, let's just go visit auntie's read when she asks!

107
00:04:50,980 --> 00:04:52,980
What worries you?

108
00:04:53,980 --> 00:04:58,980
Now that I have progressed to a very exciting point in my memoirs.

109
00:04:58,980 --> 00:05:01,980
I hear you sometimes rest from writing.

110
00:05:02,980 --> 00:05:06,980
So yeah! Put your thoughts in order and you won't do anything!

111
00:05:06,980 --> 00:05:11,980
Yeah, but when I was going to chop firewood tomorrow.

112
00:05:11,980 --> 00:05:14,980
We don't need trees when we're gone.

113
00:05:15,980 --> 00:05:22,980
It just occurred to me that I promised Hemul that I would go to see his winter flowers tomorrow.

114
00:05:22,980 --> 00:05:23,980
Father!

115
00:05:23,980 --> 00:05:24,980
So?

116
00:05:24,980 --> 00:05:27,980
Why don't you admit directly that you don't want to leave?

117
00:05:27,980 --> 00:05:29,980
I don't want to leave.

118
00:05:29,980 --> 00:05:31,980
Why?

119
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:34,980
Because muuvi papa is funny!

120
00:05:34,980 --> 00:05:38,980
In my opinion, it is impolite to refuse an invitation.

121
00:05:39,980 --> 00:05:42,980
Oh oh, of course it is.

122
00:05:44,980 --> 00:05:46,980
A lovely evening.

123
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:48,980
Healthy muuta.

124
00:05:49,980 --> 00:05:52,980
That's what came to my mind.

125
00:05:52,980 --> 00:05:55,980
Dad, how about we go to Aunt Jenny's tonight?

126
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:57,980
Ah, the only one right now.

127
00:05:57,980 --> 00:06:02,980
Yes, it would be fun to look at the sky when the stars are twinkling.

128
00:06:02,980 --> 00:06:04,980
Oh, how romantic.

129
00:06:05,980 --> 00:06:08,980
Dad, that's a good idea. Let's go right now.

130
00:06:08,980 --> 00:06:10,980
I support muuvi mamma!

131
00:06:10,980 --> 00:06:11,980
So do I.

132
00:06:11,980 --> 00:06:12,980
Joo.

133
00:06:15,980 --> 00:06:18,980
Look at the northern lights.

134
00:06:18,980 --> 00:06:20,980
How do they fly?

135
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:21,980
It's beautiful.

136
00:06:21,980 --> 00:06:26,980
Just keep an eye on them and be careful.

137
00:06:26,980 --> 00:06:27,980
For what?

138
00:06:27,980 --> 00:06:32,980
Stars and aurora borealis and thick braids attract the snow salmon snake to the surface.

139
00:06:32,980 --> 00:06:34,980
Snow salmon snake?

140
00:06:34,980 --> 00:06:35,980
Hi, hey.

141
00:06:35,980 --> 00:06:37,980
Is it dangerous?

142
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:40,980
There is! It only eats brown creatures.

143
00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:44,980
I feel like we should turn back.

144
00:06:44,980 --> 00:06:49,980
I will protect you. I haven't been able to bite into a salmon roe for several weeks.

145
00:06:49,980 --> 00:06:50,980
Don't be funny.

146
00:06:51,980 --> 00:06:54,980
What if the snow salmon finger is very big?

147
00:06:54,980 --> 00:06:56,980
The more I can bite.

148
00:06:56,980 --> 00:07:00,980
Nipsu, you're only thinking about the dinner that's waiting for us.

149
00:07:01,980 --> 00:07:05,980
There is so much snow that I have lost my way.

150
00:07:05,980 --> 00:07:06,980
What?

151
00:07:06,980 --> 00:07:10,980
Oh, the horror. Snow salmon can suddenly appear.

152
00:07:10,980 --> 00:07:15,980
Now we just have to stay calm and conserve our strength.

153
00:07:19,980 --> 00:07:22,980
That's probably the bottom star.

154
00:07:22,980 --> 00:07:26,980
Therefore, Jennitad's house should be in that direction.

155
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:28,980
Come after me.

156
00:07:30,980 --> 00:07:31,980
Father!

157
00:07:33,980 --> 00:07:34,980
Oh, father disappeared!

158
00:07:34,980 --> 00:07:35,980
Nothing!

159
00:07:35,980 --> 00:07:36,980
where are you

160
00:07:36,980 --> 00:07:39,980
Now that snow salmon finger ate Moominpapa in its mouth.

161
00:07:40,980 --> 00:07:41,980
Certainly.

162
00:07:41,980 --> 00:07:42,980
Get angry, Nipsu!

163
00:07:42,980 --> 00:07:44,980
Father! Father!

164
00:07:45,980 --> 00:07:46,980
Father!

165
00:07:46,980 --> 00:07:50,980
It didn't happen to me, but be careful.

166
00:07:50,980 --> 00:07:52,980
Here is a deep cavity!

167
00:07:54,980 --> 00:07:55,980
Snow salmon finger!

168
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:01,980
Try eating Moominpapa!

169
00:08:02,980 --> 00:08:04,980
You'll regret it if you eat him!

170
00:08:04,980 --> 00:08:07,980
Sell, shut up and calm down!

171
00:08:08,980 --> 00:08:10,980
What do I do?

172
00:08:10,980 --> 00:08:12,980
Get Moominpappa down now!

173
00:08:12,980 --> 00:08:15,980
If you want to fight, we are ready!

174
00:08:16,980 --> 00:08:17,980
And not!

175
00:08:20,980 --> 00:08:27,980
Sorry to bother you, but would you happen to know how to get out of the forest to the people?

176
00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:30,980
Mom, I guess it said this way.

177
00:08:30,980 --> 00:08:32,980
Opa is kind.

178
00:08:32,980 --> 00:08:34,980
Oops! Thank you!

179
00:08:35,980 --> 00:08:37,980
Moomin must have understood correctly.

180
00:08:38,980 --> 00:08:40,980
Well, off you go!

181
00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:53,980
Thanks!

182
00:08:54,980 --> 00:08:56,980
Thank you, Snow Salmon Finger!

183
00:08:56,980 --> 00:08:57,980
This again!

184
00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:06,980
It had a hearty Snow Salmon finger, didn't it?

185
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:10,980
True! What can you do in the summertime?

186
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:12,980
I can't get going this hungry.

187
00:09:12,980 --> 00:09:18,980
Get up! If you get frozen, I'll stick a sticker on you before June!

188
00:09:18,980 --> 00:09:19,980
It smells in here!

189
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:21,980
Don't fool around!

190
00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:23,980
I smell food!

191
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:25,980
Good thing, where are you going?

192
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:27,980
A pinch! And sell!

193
00:09:27,980 --> 00:09:28,980
What is it about?

194
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:29,980
Know this!

195
00:09:29,980 --> 00:09:31,980
Don't leave us!

196
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:33,980
Don't run away!

197
00:09:36,980 --> 00:09:37,980
There!

198
00:09:41,980 --> 00:09:43,980
It's run away here!

199
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:45,980
It's run away here!

200
00:09:45,980 --> 00:09:47,980
It's run away here!

201
00:09:53,980 --> 00:09:55,980
That's Aunt Jenny's house now!

202
00:09:55,980 --> 00:09:57,980
We got there!

203
00:09:57,980 --> 00:09:58,980
Fortunately!

204
00:09:58,980 --> 00:10:00,980
I found that house!

205
00:10:00,980 --> 00:10:02,980
You found it, you found it!

206
00:10:02,980 --> 00:10:04,980
Nipsu smelled the house with his big nose!

207
00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:18,980
Oh yeah, I'm at Aunt Jenny's house.

208
00:10:18,980 --> 00:10:20,980
We came here last one.

209
00:10:20,980 --> 00:10:22,980
Oh, where's mom?

210
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:30,980
Are you just waking up?

211
00:10:30,980 --> 00:10:32,980
Aunt Jenny!

212
00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:34,980
Good morning!

213
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:36,980
You have not changed together!

214
00:10:36,980 --> 00:10:38,980
I have not changed together!

215
00:10:38,980 --> 00:10:40,980
I have not changed together!

216
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:42,980
I have not changed together!

217
00:10:42,980 --> 00:10:44,980
I have not changed together!

218
00:10:44,980 --> 00:10:46,980
You haven't changed at all!

219
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:48,980
That you don't know how a bird balances before?

220
00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:50,980
I've been busy with work for a long time!

221
00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:52,980
Conse silver.

222
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:54,980
Oh oh, baby, morning!

223
00:10:54,980 --> 00:10:56,980
Good morning.

224
00:10:56,980 --> 00:10:58,980
Good morning.

225
00:10:58,980 --> 00:11:00,980
Good morning.

226
00:11:00,980 --> 00:11:02,980
Children, be good!

227
00:11:02,980 --> 00:11:04,980
I don't have it at home but yes!

228
00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:06,980
Doesn't do anything.

229
00:11:06,980 --> 00:11:08,980
Let the children do their thing.

230
00:11:08,980 --> 00:11:10,980
Children should have fun.

231
00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:12,980
Fun.

232
00:11:14,260 --> 00:11:15,820
Good morning, my darling.

233
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:17,100
Good morning.

234
00:11:17,180 --> 00:11:21,620
I have promised to help Aunt Jenni in the kitchen and prepare the food.

235
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:25,100
Could you chop some firewood in the meantime?

236
00:11:25,180 --> 00:11:26,780
Me?

237
00:11:26,860 --> 00:11:32,660
Daddy, Honey, Didn't you say yesterday that you were going to have a little tree today?

238
00:11:32,740 --> 00:11:34,540
In misatta!

239
00:11:34,620 --> 00:11:37,060
I didn't know you were such a lazy worm.

240
00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:38,980
I'm not.

241
00:11:39,020 --> 00:11:42,060
Yeah, and you're getting pretty thick.

242
00:11:42,140 --> 00:11:44,700
Or chop trees?

243
00:11:44,780 --> 00:11:47,460
Let's go, let's go.

244
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:49,540
Yeah, yeah.

245
00:11:51,940 --> 00:11:55,940
I knew I shouldn't have come here.

246
00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:02,180
A delicious scent.

247
00:12:02,260 --> 00:12:03,660
Dinner is ready.

248
00:12:03,740 --> 00:12:05,980
Is there anything I can do to help?

249
00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:09,860
You don't have to. I have some pancakes left to bake.

250
00:12:09,940 --> 00:12:13,380
Then don't put too much honey on the pancakes.

251
00:12:13,460 --> 00:12:17,380
Wait, and I thought you liked honey.

252
00:12:17,460 --> 00:12:21,380
I like it, but I try to graze a little.

253
00:12:23,460 --> 00:12:26,220
Baby, don't worry about your weight.

254
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:30,460
Children should eat what they like. That's good.

255
00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:34,140
You and I would look funny if we were thin.

256
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:35,220
Perhaps.

257
00:12:35,260 --> 00:12:39,420
Hey, stop. You can't put too many dates in that soup.

258
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:41,700
Or that you too?

259
00:12:41,780 --> 00:12:44,660
Sell if you don't eat it, and you don't grow this.

260
00:12:44,740 --> 00:12:48,740
You bastards, you're going to be a tall shop.

261
00:12:48,820 --> 00:12:51,820
How dare Aunty say that?

262
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:59,900
Ouch. Best bye before I see you.

263
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:04,580
Auntie will assign extra work if she pleases me.

264
00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:07,660
Hmm. I'll play here.

265
00:13:09,740 --> 00:13:12,740
You won't find me here.

266
00:13:12,820 --> 00:13:15,820
Did you stop chopping trees?

267
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:19,900
The trees have been chopped.

268
00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:23,980
Good. Next, you can then scrub the floors.

269
00:13:24,060 --> 00:13:27,060
Phooey. Just sorry.

270
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:32,100
First you sweep. Slice the living room and the couple of bedrooms behind it.

271
00:13:32,180 --> 00:13:35,180
Oh, that's what happened here.

272
00:13:35,260 --> 00:13:39,260
Jellitätä treats muvi papa like a little child.

273
00:13:39,340 --> 00:13:41,340
Really.

274
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:44,420
Hi, you can help me.

275
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:47,500
Dad, we have to clean upstairs.

276
00:13:47,580 --> 00:13:50,580
Exactly. Shall we clean up the competition?

277
00:13:50,660 --> 00:13:52,660
Let's get started.

278
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:55,740
What door is that? Wait and see.

279
00:13:58,140 --> 00:14:02,140
Sell! What are you doing here?

280
00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:05,220
I was playing hide and seek.

281
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:08,300
You can't open those doors, do you understand?

282
00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:10,380
Of course.

283
00:14:10,460 --> 00:14:15,460
I'm secretly excited about something. I smell a secret.

284
00:14:16,020 --> 00:14:19,020
Beautiful furniture.

285
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:22,100
And an old gramophone. Wow.

286
00:14:22,180 --> 00:14:25,180
This must be Jännität's room.

287
00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:28,260
The roof has a musty smell.

288
00:14:28,340 --> 00:14:31,340
And it doesn't smell.

289
00:14:31,420 --> 00:14:34,420
I carry a lot of books.

290
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:37,500
An old photo album.

291
00:14:37,580 --> 00:14:40,580
Is there a Moomin in it?

292
00:14:40,660 --> 00:14:42,660
At that.

293
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:45,700
It's a daddy's little girl.

294
00:14:45,780 --> 00:14:48,780
Moominpapa seems to be the wildest.

295
00:14:48,860 --> 00:14:52,860
I understand why he is afraid of Jännitäti.

296
00:14:55,620 --> 00:14:59,620
I'll come to help. I just finished dinner.

297
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:02,700
You've been busy since morning.

298
00:15:02,780 --> 00:15:06,780
I'm used to it. Leave the cleaning to me.

299
00:15:06,860 --> 00:15:09,860
Look at what the children are.

300
00:15:10,220 --> 00:15:13,220
Hey sell. Do you see something?

301
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:15,300
Too dark.

302
00:15:15,380 --> 00:15:18,380
Let's go inside. It scares me.

303
00:15:18,460 --> 00:15:21,460
Not me. In.

304
00:15:21,540 --> 00:15:24,540
A bit dark. Go ahead.

305
00:15:24,620 --> 00:15:27,620
That's all. My pacifier.

306
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:30,700
I don't push either.

307
00:15:30,780 --> 00:15:33,780
Haa!

308
00:15:33,860 --> 00:15:36,860
Haa!

309
00:15:36,860 --> 00:15:39,860
Haa!

310
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:42,940
What happened, Nipsu?

311
00:15:43,020 --> 00:15:47,020
Look over there. That's just armor.

312
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:51,100
Is there? There is. And it's not scary at all.

313
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:03,300
Just a pile of junk. What is this?

314
00:16:04,140 --> 00:16:08,140
It's beautiful. It's a jewel box.

315
00:16:08,220 --> 00:16:12,220
It won't open. Let me try.

316
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:15,300
I'll get it open.

317
00:16:15,380 --> 00:16:18,380
What's the trick here?

318
00:16:21,060 --> 00:16:25,060
It's fine. Beautiful tune. So do I.

319
00:16:34,260 --> 00:16:37,260
It is.

320
00:16:37,340 --> 00:16:40,340
You have found the music box.

321
00:16:40,420 --> 00:16:43,420
Father!

322
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:46,500
Very beautiful sound.

323
00:16:55,860 --> 00:16:58,860
The dog stopped.

324
00:16:58,940 --> 00:17:01,940
Did it break?

325
00:17:02,780 --> 00:17:06,780
Ruvi must have lost his old age.

326
00:17:06,860 --> 00:17:09,860
Can you get it in place?

327
00:17:09,940 --> 00:17:13,940
Don't worry. Absolutely.

328
00:17:14,020 --> 00:17:18,020
Aunt Jenni, what's wrong with you?

329
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:23,100
The music reminded me of my ex-fiancé.

330
00:17:23,180 --> 00:17:26,180
Even though it's been so long.

331
00:17:26,260 --> 00:17:29,260
Or the groom?

332
00:17:29,260 --> 00:17:33,260
A wedge Jais wide of the music box from him.

333
00:17:33,340 --> 00:17:36,340
In very romantic circumstances.

334
00:17:36,420 --> 00:17:39,420
Just like that. I see.

335
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:43,500
A music box is certainly associated with many sweet memories of youth.

336
00:17:43,580 --> 00:17:47,580
Indeed. I put the jukebox aside decades ago.

337
00:17:47,660 --> 00:17:51,660
I forgot about it. Now all the memories are vividly coming back to mind.

338
00:17:51,740 --> 00:17:55,740
I'm glad the kids found the music box.

339
00:17:56,420 --> 00:18:00,420
Thanks everyone. I am so happy.

340
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:12,500
Hear it more to the right.

341
00:18:12,580 --> 00:18:14,580
Is it good now?

342
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:17,660
Why is it taking so long?

343
00:18:17,740 --> 00:18:20,740
Don't rush.

344
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:23,820
Just put it. That's what it's for.

345
00:18:23,860 --> 00:18:26,860
What are these?

346
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:29,940
Dead! Nami!

347
00:18:30,020 --> 00:18:34,020
Now the room is decorated. The next six are applied for.

348
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:37,100
Six? For what the hell?

349
00:18:37,180 --> 00:18:41,180
Goodness. Today is its Christmas Eve.

350
00:18:41,260 --> 00:18:44,260
Not again, I guess.

351
00:18:44,340 --> 00:18:47,340
Christmas Eve?

352
00:18:47,420 --> 00:18:50,420
Don't you have a calendar?

353
00:18:50,460 --> 00:18:53,460
I invited you here because of Christmas.

354
00:18:53,540 --> 00:18:56,540
Just like that. Now I understand.

355
00:19:00,060 --> 00:19:04,060
Father, what kind of Christmas must it be?

356
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:07,140
Big and beautiful, I just think.

357
00:19:07,220 --> 00:19:10,220
Is that appropriate?

358
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:13,300
Undersized. Let's look for something a little stronger.

359
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:16,380
Same as dad.

360
00:19:17,380 --> 00:19:21,380
Too high. It can't be straight.

361
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:24,460
It can be easily decorated.

362
00:19:24,540 --> 00:19:27,540
Vinna! The Christmas tree is a specialty.

363
00:19:27,620 --> 00:19:30,620
It is.

364
00:19:36,620 --> 00:19:40,620
I want to thank everyone for what you have done.

365
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:43,700
You have been very hardworking.

366
00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:48,740
Moominmamma helped with cooking and cleaning.

367
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:51,820
Thank you. You are a real financial miracle.

368
00:19:55,140 --> 00:19:58,140
So did you, Moominpapa.

369
00:19:58,220 --> 00:20:02,220
You have changed for the better over the years.

370
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:05,300
Thanks to you too.

371
00:20:09,140 --> 00:20:12,140
Tati went into that room.

372
00:20:12,180 --> 00:20:15,180
Here are some Christmas shovels for you.

373
00:20:15,260 --> 00:20:18,260
That's why you couldn't go there.

374
00:20:18,340 --> 00:20:21,340
Here's a package for everyone.

375
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:24,420
Full of gifts.

376
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:27,500
Miniature ship model. Nice mug.

377
00:20:27,580 --> 00:20:30,580
I got the gloves. What a lot of cookies.

378
00:20:30,660 --> 00:20:33,660
There is always a need for underwear.

379
00:20:33,740 --> 00:20:36,740
I'm not a black fill pen.

380
00:20:36,820 --> 00:20:40,820
Be so pleased that you liked my gifts.

381
00:20:40,900 --> 00:20:44,900
I haven't had such a fun Christmas in years.

382
00:20:44,980 --> 00:20:48,980
What a good gift I got from you.

383
00:20:49,060 --> 00:20:53,060
As far as I know, we didn't give aunt any gift.

384
00:20:53,140 --> 00:20:55,140
Yes, you did.

385
00:20:55,220 --> 00:20:59,220
I got a happy laugh and happy memories of my youth.

386
00:21:04,980 --> 00:21:07,980
Tati means bell ringer.

387
00:21:08,020 --> 00:21:11,020
I can come here anytime for a laugh.

388
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:13,500
With food pay or?

389
00:21:13,580 --> 00:21:15,580
It's true.
