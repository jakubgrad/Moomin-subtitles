1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Once again, a lazy day is celebrated in Muunilaakso.

2
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,000
A bit boring.

3
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Very boring. I miss something new.

4
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Everything here is familiar through and through.

5
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
We should go on a long journey.

6
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Traveling must be fun, right?

7
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
However, I am not tired of Muunilaakso.

8
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Why do you always leave?

9
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I don't really know, I guess I have to.

10
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,000
If I didn't go away from time to time, I could forget that Muunilaakso is the best place in the world.

11
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Funny! Hey, someone's coming!

12
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Weird looking guy.

13
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Doesn't know good.

14
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Good morning!

15
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Good day!

16
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Is this Muunilaakso?

17
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
There is. Are you possibly looking for a specific person?

18
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Yes. I would have to meet Mr. Moominpapa. The name sounds strange.

19
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
He is my father.

20
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Show the way to him.

21
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Good day. You had something for me.

22
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Unfortunately, I bring a message of sadness to your home.

23
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Ai.

24
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Baroni Grille has moved from time to age.

25
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Are you crying?

26
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Don't you know your own relatives?

27
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Maybe it's your relatives, mom.

28
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
No, I don't think I've heard that name.

29
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:42,000
I can't fathom this kind of algal origin, Mr. Moominpapa.

30
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Baroni Grille was a fairly close relative of your little cousin in the sixth generation.

31
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
God bless the man.

32
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:56,000
So. I can't tell you that it was extremely difficult for us to find you, Mr. Moominpapa.

33
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Five years of full-time work was wasted on that.

34
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
No use because of the trouble time!

35
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Not at all, my lady.

36
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:10,000
All of Baroni Grille's close relatives have gone to mananamajos a long time ago.

37
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:15,000
We have found out that Mr. Moominpappa is the sole heir of Baroni Grille.

38
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Or inherit?

39
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
It has a list of Grille subscriptions.

40
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Could you kindly certify with our signature that we have fulfilled our obligations?

41
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
What does this Grillenkartano mean?

42
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:34,000
One of the last large farms in our country has passed into your ownership.

43
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Cultivating it will be a duty greater than demanding challenges.

44
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Japa! I don't mind any challenges.

45
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,000
There is enough to take care of in the Moomin house. I don't need a farm.

46
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Mind your words, Moominpapa.

47
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:54,000
I care little for farmland. I don't even like gardening.

48
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Couldn't the mansion be given to a non-relative?

49
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:01,000
For many, that would be a nice surprise, I'm sure!

50
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Oh well, good time. That would be against the spirit of the law.

51
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
That, sorry.

52
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
So what?

53
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:14,000
My name is Nipsu and I am very similar to Moomin. You could say I'm kind of related.

54
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
And you don't belong! You should be ashamed!

55
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Why?

56
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Are you saying that if no one takes care of the krill manor, you'll take it?

57
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:27,000
I don't see anything wrong with you. Don't ruin my chances.

58
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Young man, just being friends with Moomin doesn't make you a badass.

59
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:35,000
It must be said that the refusal of inheritance is exceptional.

60
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:39,000
I'll have to go back and look for precedents.

61
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Sorry, we always seem to go against expectations.

62
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:49,000
This is not what I meant to tell you, but perhaps you chose wisely.

63
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
I am happy for you.

64
00:03:52,000 --> 00:04:00,000
No one has taken care of Krillen's mansion for five years and rumor has it that it is haunted.

65
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Haunted?

66
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
It's haunted!

67
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
They say strange things have happened there.

68
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
The ghosts are excited and so on.

69
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:15,000
No living creature dares to set foot in the mansion's rooms anymore.

70
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Real ghosts, huh?

71
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Real ones, of course. You really like me. It's a haunted mansion.

72
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:27,000
There could be a crash or a torture chamber!

73
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:32,000
It's hard to notice at first glance, but the floor of the building is soaked

74
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
and the garden is simply awful.

75
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
How so terrible?

76
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:42,000
No one has mowed or weeded for years. The garden is an almost impenetrable jungle.

77
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Jungle?

78
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Jungle!

79
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,000
To tell the truth, scary sounds are coming from there.

80
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Sounds fun.

81
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
The jungle is wildly exciting.

82
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000
A castle covered with vines from Rovantti.

83
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,000
A ghost in a harajuku suit.

84
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
I think I sleep next to the Moomins.

85
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Dad let's go already.

86
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:05,000
I want to go! Is ave's armor transparent?

87
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Mom, shall we go?

88
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Dad, I think you'd enjoy being there.

89
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Well, let's go then.

90
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Let's go!

91
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
I live in a torture chamber!

92
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
There must be an aari there.

93
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Absolutely crazy crowd.

94
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Why did we see such a terrible speed in Porha?

95
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
I want to rest and eat bread.

96
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,000
But we took a break from our snip roots.

97
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Nuuska Muikkunen was wise.

98
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
He is currently sitting drinking tea.

99
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
You would have stayed home.

100
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
And it's still not too late to turn back.

101
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:43,000
I'll kick you so fast that you spin all the way!

102
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Isn't this Krillen's mansion?

103
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Should be.

104
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
It must now be called the Moomin mansion.

105
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Hey, you can see the main building here!

106
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
More fun than you imagined!

107
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Hi, I'm so sorry. I didn't know you were in it.

108
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:39,000
By the way, this is not your sleep shirt.

109
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Kalpis was pissed off about it.

110
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Help!

111
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Oh, out of the way!

112
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Oh, come on, don't get in the way like that!

113
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Hey, don't be kidding, peck! Stop cursing!

114
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Amazing jungle, visit man-eating chickens!

115
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Help!

116
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Ai, ai.

117
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:16,080
Ai, ai, ai.

118
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:18,160
Nipsu, you hold on or you fall.

119
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:20,240
You are very forward.

120
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:22,320
This is how it wants to be, go ahead.

121
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,400
Oh!

122
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:26,480
Cujut, cujut, cujut.

123
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:28,560
Oh!

124
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:30,640
No, no.

125
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:35,200
Jump on the horse when Nipsu has gone upside down.

126
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:38,160
Plow it.

127
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:40,240
Plow it.

128
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:42,480
All powers...

129
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Aha.

130
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:50,080
Gentleman-looking.

131
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:52,160
Cook.

132
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:54,240
Don't shout. There's nobody here.

133
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:56,320
Ghosts at most.

134
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:58,400
Ghosts.

135
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:11,040
Uli ice ancestors.

136
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:29,120
Ai.

137
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:31,200
Help. The door just beckons me.

138
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:33,280
All kinds of things are always hurting you.

139
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:40,080
I would like this library room.

140
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:42,160
So to Moominvalley.

141
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:44,240
May I come?

142
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:46,320
Just come.

143
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:48,400
I'll start looking.

144
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:50,480
Hi, hi.

145
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:54,560
I would really like to take a kitchen like this to Moominvalley.

146
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:59,120
Not a soul.

147
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:15,200
Oh, no, no. Must not.

148
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:17,280
I'm not starting anything.

149
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:19,360
I found you.

150
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:21,440
Nisku-neiti and the fox sell in the same hiding place.

151
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:23,520
What makes you think that?

152
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,600
I heard how popular they were.

153
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:27,760
Inappropriate.

154
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:29,840
Did you hear the Moomin troll?

155
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:31,920
I heard. Takuu didn't have a nisku-miss or sell.

156
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
So who was it?

157
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:36,080
I don't know.

158
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:38,160
We could ask.

159
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:40,240
No. I don't want to know anyway.

160
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:42,320
Why don't you want to?

161
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:44,400
I don't like invisible voices.

162
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:46,480
Let's go away.

163
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:48,560
Oh Moomin, what now?

164
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:50,640
You look over there.

165
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:52,720
There's something strange about that bed.

166
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,800
How is that?

167
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:56,880
How so weird?

168
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:58,960
Miss Nisku and myi are hiding there.

169
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:01,040
I don't like it here.

170
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:03,120
Don't feel like playing hide and seek.

171
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:05,200
Let's go out.

172
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:14,400
Hey, I found you.

173
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:16,480
You too, little girl.

174
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:18,560
I found you both.

175
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:20,640
And you didn't find it?

176
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,720
Just like that. What do you say now?

177
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:26,960
I guessed. In the same hiding place.

178
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:29,040
Don't run away.

179
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:31,120
Oh, make-up, don't use it, Tirti.

180
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:33,200
You break into Gravi year.

181
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:35,280
That voice again.

182
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:37,360
What now?

183
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:39,440
Get out of Gravi Freirik's bed.

184
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:41,520
Let's obey the voice. Get out of bed, everyone.

185
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,600
But the bed feels solid.

186
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:45,680
Oh shit.

187
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:56,800
How do I get a bandaged white?

188
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:05,840
Trees as if on order.

189
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:09,920
It sounds like the younger generation has invented it again.

190
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Where is the little one?

191
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:16,080
Hey sell!

192
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:18,160
I am Finland.

193
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:20,240
I am Finland.

194
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:22,320
I am Finland.

195
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:24,400
I am Finland.

196
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:26,480
I am myy.

197
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:28,560
Myy went with the bed.

198
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:30,640
I'm here.

199
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:32,720
Thanks and praise.

200
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:36,800
I should have known that we never have to worry about small sales.

201
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:38,880
No need!

202
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:42,960
I'm so small that nothing can happen to me!

203
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:56,400
There's someone here. I feel it.

204
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:26,400
Hey there!

205
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:28,480
Hey, don't go!

206
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:32,560
Your voice saved us from falling with the bed, didn't it?

207
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:36,640
We would like to thank you for that good.

208
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:38,720
I tried to save for a year.

209
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:42,800
Pity the bed, and sorry for scaring you.

210
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:44,880
Here.

211
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:48,960
I haven't experienced others in a long time.

212
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:51,040
700 years ago.

213
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:53,520
I haven't experienced others in a long time.

214
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:57,600
For 700 years, although I would have to say a long time here.

215
00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:00,680
Well, I was a little scared actually.

216
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:03,760
If you think about it more, I was scared.

217
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:06,840
Good, you look very interesting.

218
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:08,920
Your shape is just so white.

219
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,000
I probably would have freaked you out more,

220
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:14,080
unless I had seen ghosts before.

221
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:16,160
I have experience with them.

222
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:18,240
Oh, right?

223
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:21,720
I saw one ghost on a lighthouse island.

224
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:23,800
It had come there on a ghost ship.

225
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:25,880
How romantic?

226
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:27,960
Well, sort of.

227
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:32,040
And my father knew a ghost in his youth, and they were good friends.

228
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:35,120
I envied a happy papa.

229
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:37,200
Why?

230
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:40,280
I'm the only ghost left in Krillen Manor.

231
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:43,360
Others went with the wind in the black night,

232
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:45,440
while the Christmas storm rages.

233
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:47,520
1634.

234
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:50,760
And one morning Gravy Freric was gone,

235
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:52,840
without me noticing anything.

236
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:55,920
Then you probably haven't talked in a long time.

237
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
For two centuries.

238
00:13:58,080 --> 00:14:00,080
It's horrible.

239
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:02,160
Yes, and I like to talk,

240
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:05,240
Gravy Freric thought I talked too much.

241
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:08,320
I'm sure the wind took Grav too.

242
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:10,400
A headwind maybe.

243
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:13,480
Well, now you know how badly I miss aadinkoni

244
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:16,560
keen listener and sympathizer.

245
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:20,360
Sounds incredible.

246
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:22,440
Did you really talk to a ghost?

247
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:25,520
I spoke. His name is Black Gravitar

248
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:27,600
and he misses company.

249
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:29,680
I could talk to a ghost

250
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:31,760
through forgotten bones

251
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:34,840
or the trembling shadow of a thousand graves.

252
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:36,920
The ghost wants to talk to me.

253
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:40,000
I like a man of few words.

254
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:44,080
Let's have a ghost for dinner.

255
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:46,160
How about some cold cuts?

256
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:49,640
In the light of day, I too could meet a ghost.

257
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:51,720
And you couldn't. And why?

258
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:53,800
Because then you'd be too scared.

259
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:56,160
I'm not afraid in the light of day.

260
00:14:56,240 --> 00:15:00,240
Black Gravitar does not want to be seen during the day.

261
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:02,320
He is afraid of light.

262
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:05,400
I tell you what. The light of day turns him into a pumpkin.

263
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:07,400
Hehehe.

264
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:10,400
Aaaaaah!

265
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:12,400
Aaaaaah!

266
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:18,400
Sorry, Goblin, I thought you were a pig.

267
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:22,400
Portrait of Fredrikulla.

268
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:25,400
Fredrik had his faults, but he was really shy.

269
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:27,400
It looks like that.

270
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:30,400
Of course, but a bad listener.

271
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:32,400
He stuck wax in his ears.

272
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:36,400
I feel like we need to address that.

273
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:41,400
You're right, otherwise Voovi-Peikko can never sleep.

274
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:50,400
Oh, nocturnal bone shaker.

275
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:54,400
We urgently need your help, come now

276
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:58,400
the host of the moomin house, your ancient neighbor.

277
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:00,400
Now the letter is ready.

278
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:02,400
Well thought out.

279
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:04,400
I'm sure your Ghost friend will answer the call.

280
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:06,400
So do I.

281
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:11,400
I hope he still lives in his old place where you met him.

282
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:16,400
Our hope is now in the letter.

283
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:22,400
Move, fools, rascals, go there.

284
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:25,400
Excuse me now, but you have to move.

285
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:29,400
We have a guest and we have to clean the place.

286
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:32,400
Enter Herta and Heluna.

287
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:35,400
Don't try to play tricks on me.

288
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:37,400
I'm not a jerk.

289
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:40,400
You tent untidy in a tree.

290
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:43,400
Get off it now, like you already are.

291
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:50,400
Dad, what's going on here?

292
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:53,400
Well, we kind of have a project.

293
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:55,400
I'll talk about that later.

294
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:57,400
Now we need your help.

295
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:04,400
Look what I found in the barn.

296
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:32,400
Oh, he came.

297
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:35,400
I think he likes the mansion.

298
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:39,400
I have to say that I am very disappointed.

299
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:41,400
But for what the hell?

300
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:44,400
I want to meet a scary ghost.

301
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:47,400
You always think only of yourself.

302
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:49,400
I hope everything goes well.

303
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:51,400
It'll probably work.

304
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:54,400
The manor park has been cleaned so nicely.

305
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:57,400
We thought that the first ghost,

306
00:17:57,400 --> 00:18:00,400
not suitable for the value of the estate.

307
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:03,400
Kindly thought of, Moomin.

308
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:06,400
Oh, actually it was dad's idea. I thank him.

309
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:08,400
Oh, you can look.

310
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:10,400
I see a ghostly hamo.

311
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:14,400
Aha, father's letter worked.

312
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,400
He has come to see you.

313
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:17,400
Me?

314
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:18,400
Joo.

315
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:21,400
That's our father's ghost friend.

316
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:23,400
Father said that he was born from behind,

317
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:24,400
blue blooded.

318
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:28,400
Oh, and I haven't even done my hair and my outfit is.

319
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:31,400
There is nothing wrong with your new vision.

320
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:33,400
He seems to be looking for you.

321
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:36,400
Oh, oh, I'm blushing.

322
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:38,400
Calm down, Nervous.

323
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:40,400
Your opportunity has come.

324
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:41,400
Oh, oh.

325
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:44,400
That's where the black count is now.

326
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:58,400
You're glad we sent the letter.

327
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:00,400
Of course papa did.

328
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:01,400
Thanks.

329
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:03,400
Thanks.

330
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:05,400
Thanks.

331
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:07,400
Thanks.

332
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:09,400
Thanks.

333
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:11,400
Thanks.

334
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:13,400
Thanks.

335
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:15,400
Thanks.

336
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:17,400
Thanks.

337
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:19,400
Thanks.

338
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:21,400
Thanks.

339
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:23,400
Of course, papa listens.

340
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:56,400
Hit the joints. This is how the beloved Moomin valley looks like.

341
00:19:56,400 --> 00:20:00,400
And it looks like the best place in the world.

342
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:06,400
Hey wait. Do you have to run? Don't leave me.

343
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:10,400
You'll get something to hawk as soon as we get home.

344
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:12,400
My foot doesn't budge.

345
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:14,400
Then roll down the hill!

346
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:20,400
It was again a beautiful and relaxing day in Moomin Valley.

347
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:26,400
The weather was excellent and no one complained about getting bored.
