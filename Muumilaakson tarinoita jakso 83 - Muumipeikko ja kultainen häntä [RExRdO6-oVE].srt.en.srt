1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Let's talk

2
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Oh, the horror, the tail My tuft has thinned.

3
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
If I don't do anything, my tail may soon be completely hairless.

4
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,000
What do I do?

5
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
I don't think Mrs. Niiskunne likes him bald.

6
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Moomin, breakfast is waiting.

7
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Yeah, yeah.

8
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Good morning.

9
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Good morning.

10
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Now don't stop there.

11
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Porridge freezes Moomin.

12
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I don't want anything, I'm not hungry yet.

13
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Oops, doesn't sound like Moomin.

14
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Is something bothering Moomin?

15
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I don't know.

16
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
He seems strange.

17
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I'm going for a walk.

18
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
He walks strangely.

19
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
He is not himself.

20
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Oh, I'm in trouble.

21
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Moomin troll.

22
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Moist way.

23
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Hello Moomin.

24
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Sell tomorrow.

25
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Like you freaked me out.

26
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Startled? Not now anyway.

27
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
You are used strangely.

28
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Go you are going.

29
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Just for a walk.

30
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Listen, Moomin, what are you hiding behind your back?

31
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
I'm not hiding anything.

32
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
You're hiding a lie, right?

33
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
I already told you, I'm not hiding anything.

34
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Yes, you are hiding.

35
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Well, I don't.

36
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Too.

37
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
I can't.

38
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

39
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Did it hurt you?

40
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Did you notice that Moomin was out of his place?

41
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
He was quirky.

42
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Hurry now, Niiskunneiti.

43
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Oh, it was spot on.

44
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Thank goodness and praise they didn't see my tail.

45
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Fortunately.

46
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
But I can't hide the tail forever.

47
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Oh what I do.

48
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Hey, you're up early.

49
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
What's wrong with you?

50
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
No.

51
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Good morning, Snuska, Muikkunen.

52
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Why are you feeling so weird?

53
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
You're just imagining.

54
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Jaha, would you like to go fishing with me?

55
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Another time.

56
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
I'm a bit busy now.

57
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Moomin was amazing.

58
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000
I have to go see Kaino.

59
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
He has a lot of hair.

60
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:55,000
And he may well know how to make hair grow on his tail.

61
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Who's that?

62
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Moomin?

63
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
What business can you have with me?

64
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
No-kun. . .

65
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
All...

66
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Tell, don't chatter.

67
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
My thing is about that hair.

68
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
That...

69
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
I mean...

70
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Oh, but you don't seem to have any hair.

71
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
What...

72
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Can it be done not to become bald?

73
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Not to become bald.

74
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:34,000
I was just thinking, what do you do when you have such thick hair?

75
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Oh, I do, I don't do anything.

76
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,000
I only have healthy hair because I live a healthy life.

77
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Baldness is caused by destructive lifestyles.

78
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Hi, hey.

79
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Just ask Hemul.

80
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
He is bookish and bald besides.

81
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
I've never been able to get bald people from there.

82
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Aha.

83
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Or kaljuusvaivaa.

84
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Try this hair lotion of mine.

85
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Could it be good?

86
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
There is nothing better than that.

87
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
I have been using it for over thirty years.

88
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Just like that. Just thank you.

89
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Thirty years.

90
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Moomin, Are you trying to grow hair?

91
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Who said that?

92
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Kaino, of course. He told us.

93
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Why can't I be left alone?

94
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Even once.

95
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000
What the hell do you need hair for?

96
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Mind your own business.

97
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Hey, Moomin, wait.

98
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
He has snapped.

99
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
It is.

100
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Sticking their beaks everywhere.

101
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Moomin!

102
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Moomin, come play.

103
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
I was waiting for you.

104
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Sorry, but I'm busy.

105
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
I came, yeah.

106
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
What's wrong with the boy?

107
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
He is not himself at all.

108
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Moomin trolls around like a crab.

109
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Runs away.

110
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Mummy!

111
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Moomin!

112
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
I'm coming now.

113
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Moomin, what's wrong?

114
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
I guess you don't have any worries.

115
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Maybe you're worried about something that starts with the letter h?

116
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
How did you guess that?

117
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Well, I'm your father after all.

118
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,000
You know you can tell us everything, right?

119
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
I know, yeah.

120
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:07,000
So what about it? It's your tail.

121
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Look at the tassel on its head.

122
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
What for?

123
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
It has started to go bald.

124
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Yeah, I see. It has thinned out.

125
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Now it is much easier to keep him clean.

126
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Absolutely. And you get rid of burdocks and resin and many other annoyances.

127
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:28,000
The father is such that he can't come up with good things.

128
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Fortunately, I thought of it.

129
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Don't try to comfort me. This is a serious matter.

130
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:40,000
I'm sorry, of course. Is it because of him that you behave so strangely?

131
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:45,000
What if all the tufts fall out and he becomes bald?

132
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
So what do I do?

133
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
My Moomin Park.

134
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Could she find a cure in her grandmother's recipe book?

135
00:06:54,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Could he be found in your grandmother's recipe book as a cure for the ingrown hairs that are bothering you?

136
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Could he? Go see it now.

137
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
I'll go.

138
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
It's scary here.

139
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Not nearly as scary as the fact that you'll soon be walking around bald.

140
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:27,000
How can these help? They look like normal plants.

141
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:33,000
They are common, but you have to pick them at the time of the new moon in the glow of the stars.

142
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Grandma knew a thing or two about medicine.

143
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Did grandma make this medicine for someone?

144
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
It may very well be.

145
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Now these are probably enough.

146
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,000
I think the soup is getting ready.

147
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
This smells good.

148
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
The liquid is still hot.

149
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,000
It's hard for me to believe that the drink is going bad.

150
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
After all, it's grandma's medicine.

151
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
I don't notice any change.

152
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Moomipeikko, he just took medicine, but tomorrow morning he will have a thick tail tuft again.

153
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Yeah, so we'll wait to see what the situation looks like tomorrow morning.

154
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Well, and now I got to bed Moomin.

155
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Good night.

156
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Hey, oh no! Wake up, mom and dad, it's horrible!

157
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Good morning, Moompeikko. What now? Isn't this supported?

158
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
It is, but look.

159
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Good unusual.

160
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Heaven's tallow candles, how did that happen?

161
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Good.

162
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Hey, look.

163
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Hey, look.

164
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Hey, look.

165
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Hey, look.

166
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Hey, look.

167
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Hey, look, how did that happen?

168
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,000
I've never seen one of those.

169
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Hi, golden tail!

170
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Doesn't do anything, I do!

171
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Amazing thing!

172
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,000
I guess it wasn't a big mistake for mom.

173
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Golden tail.

174
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Unheard of, we do we Gitu!

175
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Oh, Muu mipiikko. It's over!

176
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Why did you come? I don't want to meet anyone today.

177
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:42,000
You are rude. I came to see if you're still bald.

178
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Nothing bothers me.

179
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Don't be a tree palturium. Show your tail.

180
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
And I don't show.

181
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
You show.

182
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Look then.

183
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Looks golden. Be careful not to have your tail stolen by a snitch.

184
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:02,000
I can't understand this. We followed grandma's recipe exactly.

185
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
It's really a mess.

186
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Hello news.

187
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Sell, shut up.

188
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Moomin has a golden tail.

189
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:22,000
I didn't tell you that the medicine can cause side effects, but they will go away in a couple of weeks.

190
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Ai.

191
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:28,000
At the next full moon, your tail will no longer be golden.

192
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Everyone is here.

193
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
They are.

194
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Dad, come here. We're busy.

195
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Sell, why did you go tell everyone?

196
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
No need to hide.

197
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Or vice versa. Everyone wants to see your golden tail.

198
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,000
I don't want to be a showpiece.

199
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Moomin looks golden.

200
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Let's go.

201
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Let's go.

202
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Let's go.

203
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Let's go.

204
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Let's go.

205
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Let's go.

206
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Let's go.

207
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Let's go.

208
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,200
Let's go.

209
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Let's go.

210
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Let's go.

211
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Let's go.

212
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Let's go.

213
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Let's go.

214
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:17,000
I promise that everyone will get to see the golden tail in turn.

215
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Don't stand there like anything. Now turn around and show your tail.

216
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Yeah, but... Roar now!

217
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Do not touch! If you have already seen the tail, you can hand it over to the next person in line.

218
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,000
The situation is starting to get out of hand.

219
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
I think you're right.

220
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
I can't admire it enough.

221
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
You can get a lot of money for it.

222
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:55,000
My Moomin has a wonderful golden tail.

223
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
That, you know...

224
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,000
No two tails are the same.

225
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:05,000
It's true. You have become world famous overnight.

226
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Come on, you don't know.

227
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:12,000
At no point should you show off your tail for free.

228
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
I have an idea moomin troll.

229
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
What have you come up with?

230
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Nipsu, talk to me, then I'm the managers of Moomin!

231
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Those who want to see the golden tail bring something of the size as an entrance fee.

232
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,000
It doesn't work for free anymore.

233
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Hello Snuff, do you want to see Moomin's golden tail?

234
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Well, I don't really think so.

235
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Why not, it's u...

236
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Moomin, believe me, fame is only a shame.

237
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Go dip your tail in tar and the people will leave you alone.

238
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Ah, do you really believe that?

239
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Nuuska Muikkunen, you're sour and still so stubborn that you can't give up a single fish.

240
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Not only.

241
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Well, stay in line.

242
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:09,000
The world's only golden tail hides under this raspberry cotton fabric.

243
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:13,000
If you want to see the tail, place your bringing here on the cloth.

244
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Here's how.

245
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Pie.

246
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
All right.

247
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Nipsu, are you ready?

248
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Here it is.

249
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Oh!

250
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Ahead.

251
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Don't be stuck with others.

252
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:30,000
I want a golden tail too.

253
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,000
I would shave it once a week.

254
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:37,000
And then I would take the golden herons to the bank.

255
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Yes, it looked like real gold.

256
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Her tail was amazing.

257
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:48,000
We get awfully cheesy this way.

258
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Moominmamma doesn't need to do after-use.

259
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Of course.

260
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,000
The audience gets to see your unique tail.

261
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Yeah, but still.

262
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:01,000
Make sure nothing happens to you.

263
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Mummy Moomin.

264
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
What is it?

265
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
I would like to ask a favor.

266
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Well, what about the service?

267
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
I would like to.

268
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
What service?

269
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Well, what about the service?

270
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,000
I wish I had a golden tail.

271
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Just like Moomin has.

272
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Just like that.

273
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
It's not yet a new moon.

274
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
But I can try.

275
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Lovely.

276
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Oh, thank you Moomin.

277
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Yes.

278
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:47,000
So I only drink a magic potion made from these herbs.

279
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
That's how I get a golden tail.

280
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
What?

281
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Exactly.

282
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Aha, or nothing else is needed.

283
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Then I'll try it too.

284
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Oh, what a tease.

285
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Now the soup has boiled.

286
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
They know each other.

287
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:10,000
And after I've had a drink, tomorrow morning...

288
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:14,000
I make the potion in the same way as for Moomin.

289
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Now I taste.

290
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Tomorrow morning I will be completely golden.

291
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
My tail.

292
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Oh, it scares me to look at it.

293
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Oh, I hope the tail has turned golden.

294
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Yours.

295
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
Didn't change.

296
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Didn't change.

297
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:08,000
I guessed it, I have been deceived.

298
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:12,000
But they become golden in some other way.

299
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,000
My tail didn't change either.

300
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Anna, sorry I couldn't help.

301
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
It's okay, Mummy.

302
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:26,000
It seems that the herbs must be collected at the time of the new moon after all.

303
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Golden tail is not for everyone.

304
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Moomin troll.

305
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
I'm going out for a while.

306
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Oh yeah.

307
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
Moomin, come along.

308
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
I can't make it, I'm busy.

309
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:43,000
Moomin has a very tight schedule today.

310
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Neesa Kun Id Rukka.

311
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:50,000
I feel somehow guilty.

312
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Nipsu, are you still eating?

313
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
I already finished. The plate is empty.

314
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Bye.

315
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Go you go.

316
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:00,000
I'm going with the deer and Nipsu to show my tail.

317
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,000
We don't want dessert today either.

318
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Your day, there's no way you'd want to turn your tail into gold.

319
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
Who are you?

320
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
I must not have met.

321
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,000
I am the creator of famous magic tricks.

322
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:26,000
I came here to fulfill my maiden wish.

323
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Do you know my wish then?

324
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:32,000
I knew it the moment I saw the young lady's face.

325
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
She wants a golden tail.

326
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:38,000
Miss is coming along so make her a golden tail.

327
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,000
Will I really get a golden tail?

328
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
Absolutely.

329
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
Let's go now.

330
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,000
Settle down, everything is fine.

331
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Well, bring yours out if you want to see a golden tail.

332
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,000
Put the imports here, please.

333
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Good.

334
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Moomin, Goblin, I don't think it's appropriate for you to accept treats for looking at your tail.

335
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:14,000
That's not why I looked for your grandmother's recipe.

336
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Sorry.

337
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
Dude, where are you going?

338
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Children, tomorrow this fun will end.

339
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Tonight is the full moon and the gold is disappearing.

340
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
Has it been two weeks already?

341
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Yes, fourteen days.

342
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,000
Well, I don't really care about desserts anymore.

343
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,000
A pinch!

344
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:39,000
Leave the treats there and go with me to find Miss Niisku.

345
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,000
I'm getting wet, aren't I?

346
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
Has he disappeared?

347
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:46,000
And I'm sure to be golden, right?

348
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:52,000
Hey, how far do we have to go?

349
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
Here we are.

350
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,000
Ha!

351
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Help! Help, Stink!

352
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:06,000
I apply glue to the fur and sprinkle gold on it, and hear me take your anklet.

353
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
Skunk, don't come any closer!

354
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
Ring here!

355
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,000
Another one!

356
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,000
Give it to me!

357
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,000
Help! Help!

358
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:18,000
I'm getting wet miss! I'm getting wet miss!

359
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,000
Help!

360
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,000
I'm getting wet miss!

361
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,000
Mom's boy!

362
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
I don't want to meet you.

363
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
Huh?

364
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,000
Goodbye!

365
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,000
Wait!

366
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
Why do you have a golden tail?

367
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
Keep going!

368
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
Is everything okay?

369
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,000
Yes, Mompiekka.

370
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:49,000
I just wanted to be golden-furred, Stink. This is unfair, unfair!

371
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
So your tail becomes normal.

372
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,000
So?

373
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:03,000
Now is your last chance to touch the golden tail!

374
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:08,000
Oh, how sad. That joy lasted only two weeks.

375
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,000
What grief?

376
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:16,000
When the gold disappears, can Momipeiko become a complete fool?

377
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
I bet it will!

378
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
What shall we do?

379
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
Mom, do you know what's going on?

380
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:26,000
I'm afraid grandma won't have any mention of it.

381
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
But then we'll see.

382
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
Crew cut! And that's it!

383
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
Listen, Momopeikko.

384
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:38,000
What I want to tell you is that everyone loves you and not your tail.

385
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
Keep that in mind.

386
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
Absolutely.

387
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:45,000
But I liked that old tassel tail.

388
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:48,000
The moon is rising! Full moon!

389
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:02,000
Momopeikko, now you can make eye contact.

390
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:13,000
Whoa! The tail is intact! The tassel is here again!

391
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
Thank you!
