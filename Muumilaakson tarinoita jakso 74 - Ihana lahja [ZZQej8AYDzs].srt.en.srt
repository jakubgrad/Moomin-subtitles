1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Do you have a bag today?

2
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
It's not heavy.

3
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Well, thanks.

4
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
We are about to reach it and there we can rest.

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Remember the snitch and fan with the king's ruby?

6
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,000
They have returned to Moomin Valley with their suitcase.

7
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Smoke rises from the chimney of the Moomin house.

8
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Good, grandma is cooking dinner.

9
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Moomins are so nice.

10
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
They lose our results.

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
When we have such a wonderful gift for them.

12
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Yep, I'm sure the Moomins will squeal with delight when they see it.

13
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Shall we continue the journey?

14
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Joo.

15
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I'm carrying a suitcase now.

16
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Yes, I can still do it.

17
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
The oops

18
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Sorry, lighter than I imagined.

19
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
The bag has...

20
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
I know, a gift for me.

21
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
No, there's a gift for the rest of us.

22
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
They have a house full of stuff, they don't need anything.

23
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
The suitcase is ours.

24
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Count it down world. Thanks.

25
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I show others a gift even if they don't need it.

26
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
What do we do now, Viutti?

27
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
I just don't know.

28
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Does that Rogue live here?

29
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I don't know. We won't see the last of him.

30
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
What advice?

31
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
This wretch is locked.

32
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Putrid.

33
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Why does everything have to be locked?

34
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
I want the suitcase open.

35
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
There is a small object there.

36
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
But little objects can be themes.

37
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
It opened.

38
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
I don't know.

39
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
I don't know.

40
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
I don't know.

41
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
I don't know.

42
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
I don't know.

43
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
I don't know.

44
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
I don't know.

45
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Thanks.

46
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
What is this?

47
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
It looks like a tulip bulb.

48
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
True.

49
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Oh.

50
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
A little different anyway.

51
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
You?

52
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
You name it whose suitcase it is.

53
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Well, mine. What are you talking about?

54
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Then why didn't you open the suitcase?

55
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
I was watching you.

56
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
I can go to you.

57
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Or so.

58
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
You mean you locked the bag?

59
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Of course I mean.

60
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Do you think I'm lazy?

61
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Where is that suitcase from?

62
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Sano.

63
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
You have stolen a suitcase.

64
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
And I'm not.

65
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
I found it on the ground.

66
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
It just had this onion.

67
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Outrageous.

68
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Don't stink.

69
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Au.

70
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
You can't eat it.

71
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
I've traveled.

72
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
It's not the tulip bulb.

73
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
What the hell is that?

74
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,000
I will give you the whole onion and the suitcase.

75
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Windy windy windy.

76
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Welcome.

77
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Hello Moomin.

78
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Nice to see.

79
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Long time no see.

80
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Healthy muuta.

81
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Come in now.

82
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Not standing here at the foot of the stairs.

83
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
To the end.

84
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Father guests.

85
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
A very good day.

86
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
What a surprise.

87
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Strong winds.

88
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Haven't seen you in ages.

89
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Moominpapa.

90
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
We brought you a really wonderful gift.

91
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
It wouldn't have been necessary.

92
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
You are always welcome.

93
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Mummy Moomin.

94
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
We have come up with a great gift for you.

95
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Goodness.

96
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Thank you.

97
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Do you like our gift?

98
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Of course I do.

99
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
What is that gift?

100
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
I'm really excited.

101
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Oh dear, sorry.

102
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
The gift was stolen on the way.

103
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Stolen?

104
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
And it was such an incredibly fun gift.

105
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
I sure would have liked your gift.

106
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
How sad?

107
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
I would have liked to see it.

108
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Mummy Moomin.

109
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Can we have your nature as guests, even though we don't have a gift?

110
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Of course.

111
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Stay as long as you want.

112
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Did you hear the fiddling?

113
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
I heard and I'm glad.

114
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Oh thank you Moomin.

115
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Can you tell me in more detail where the gift was stolen from you?

116
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
In this vicinity.

117
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
In Moominvalley.

118
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
That's right, it was stolen in the pass.

119
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:18,000
There aren't many thieves living around these corners.

120
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Not so, and I know that one.

121
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
he i, still beautiful.

122
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
he i, still beautiful.

123
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
he i, still beautiful.

124
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
he i, still beautiful.

125
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
he i, still beautiful.

126
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
he i, still beautiful.

127
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
he i, still beautiful.

128
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Don't bother.

129
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
You can see he's currently in the woods.

130
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Return the item you stole from our guests.

131
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Are you visiting?

132
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Oh, from them.

133
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Aha, you stole...

134
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
I don't know what you're talking about.

135
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
We are visiting a wonderful gift.

136
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Give it here.

137
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Give it back before I get mad.

138
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Or I'll be responsible for the consequences.

139
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
We calm down.

140
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Oomi, Peekko.

141
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
What did you say?

142
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Give that gift.

143
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Are you talking about a wonderful gift?

144
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
I spoke. How so?

145
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
A lovely gift.

146
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Hey, hey, hey.

147
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Someone just...

148
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
when laughing.

149
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Aha, now it's clear who Haisuli has stolen the suitcase from.

150
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
The gift is not wasted.

151
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
No, but it's not here anymore.

152
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Where is it then?

153
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:50,000
I took it to the hemul so that he could examine which plant it was.

154
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
I also took a suitcase.

155
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Or is the gift a tuber?

156
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
So, some onion.

157
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Absolutely. It looked like a tulip bulb, but I don't really think it is.

158
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:05,000
So a wonderful gift is an old onion.

159
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:10,000
It could be a bulb of a very rare plant. Hemuli doesn't seem to have felt it.

160
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000
I wish the gift had been another ruby.

161
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Ruby? Oh yes, Tiuhti and Fiuhti had stolen a ruby from a ruffian and hid it in a suitcase.

162
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Taukku was familiar.

163
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Did Tiuhti and fiuhti steal the onion too?

164
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:34,000
How do you know that? Let's go see what Hemuli is currently working on.

165
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Hemuli!

166
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Kasvar, have a good day.

167
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Is that the onion I brought yesterday? Insignificant looking.

168
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
I'm just about to plant it.

169
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
What plant is that?

170
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:00,000
No idea. I've never seen anything like it.

171
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Then it must be the bulb of a rare plant.

172
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
I'm just a little worried.

173
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
What?

174
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:12,000
The onion is damaged. Hopefully, the schools it has experienced will not prevent it from sprouting.

175
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Ah, now I remember. The skunk tried to taste the onion.

176
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Be roasted!

177
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Hey Hemuli, don't plant the onions yet.

178
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Oh, why not?

179
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Let's take the onion to the one it's meant for.

180
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Like, like that.

181
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Here comes the water!

182
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Well, will this work?

183
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Go on, please.

184
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Come on, tell us now, which plant's bulb is it?

185
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Cracked from life.

186
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Alright, let's see...

187
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Wait, Tiuhti!

188
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
What now, fan?

189
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Well, I want to tell the whole story.

190
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,000
So, what's up?

191
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Better, of course, that you tell.

192
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Tell me, yeah.

193
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:18,000
You see, if I start from the beginning, the onion doesn't come from here at all.

194
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:24,000
The onion comes from somewhere very, very far away, even further than the cuckoo.

195
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Nice to meet you.

196
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:32,000
And that is why it is rarer than any other onion and an excellent gift for our friends or for us.

197
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
A unique onion.

198
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:38,000
And the most unique thing about it is that it starts to sing.

199
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Phooey.

200
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Yes, the flower sings very well, it has a good voice.

201
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Sorry, just keep going.

202
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,000
And it sings special songs.

203
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Thanks for the botany.

204
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Maybe it's good that not all flowers sing.

205
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Where did you find the onion?

206
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Shall I tell you?

207
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Alone.

208
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
We're not even banned.

209
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Tell me already.

210
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Who did you get the onion from, unless it came from space?

211
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Well, from a magician.

212
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Of course.

213
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:15,000
The magician liked the onion, but even more the ruby.

214
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
We did trades.

215
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:21,000
The magician already had a ruby, but he obviously wanted to match it.

216
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
That's right.

217
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:27,000
But you willingly gave up the ruby.

218
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:33,000
We had it for a long time and we were sure you would like to sing about the flower.

219
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
That's fine.

220
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:40,000
We were in a lot of trouble the last time we were in the Moomin house.

221
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Right, we're fine.

222
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
We would love to come again.

223
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Nice to hear. Thank you.

224
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:53,000
I felt that it would be wise to put the onion in a bowl of water.

225
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
That age for sure.

226
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
We are monitoring its development.

227
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,000
And when it bursts into flower, it begins to sing.

228
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Not just next to the note.

229
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
How soon will it bloom?

230
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
In two days.

231
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Oh my goodness.

232
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Let's get it into the water quickly.

233
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
You you it.

234
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,000
All right. I'll dip the onion.

235
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Only two days.

236
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Grandma, can I stay here for a while?

237
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Of course he can.

238
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
I'll stay too.

239
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Two days had passed and then three.

240
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
And soon a whole week.

241
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:39,000
But the onion was just the same.

242
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Ten days had passed and the onion looked as lifeless as before.

243
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Our little guests went for a walk.

244
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:12,000
I almost thought I saw nobody singing.

245
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Maybe the onion has received too much moisture.

246
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,000
It's very possible, Mom.

247
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,000
The skunk's bite did it no good.

248
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
There are now.

249
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
There are now.

250
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
There are now.

251
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
There are now.

252
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
There are now.

253
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
That's our only chance.

254
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
But dangerous.

255
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
I don't like this at all.

256
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
We are lost.

257
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Bridges!

258
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Oh, come help! Come help!

259
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
It didn't work out.

260
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Don't worry.

261
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Help! Tilti got into trouble.

262
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Help! Help! Come and scare the crap out of me.

263
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
So you can't do it.

264
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Unfortunately I don't.

265
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Grandma could get an onion in her item, but I probably can't.

266
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Look, I haven't fully learned those yet.

267
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,000
When will your grandma come back home?

268
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Not for a while.

269
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Otherwise, I wouldn't run here.

270
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
how are you now

271
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Do you guarantee a hot drink?

272
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Yes, it grows right.

273
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
how are you now

274
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Yes, it grows right.

275
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:10,000
The singing flower grows and it still sings beautifully.

276
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Believe me?

277
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Oh, Tilti.

278
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,000
I am sure that one day the onion will still sprout.

279
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:22,000
It would be fun to hear someone sing.

280
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Everyone has somehow given up hope that the bulb would grow into a singing flower.

281
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Hemulik too, who was so excited about the gift of a fan and a fan.

282
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Why don't you east?

283
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Are there signs of germination?

284
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
It doesn't show.

285
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Did you stop watching?

286
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:49,000
I stopped. Difficult observation when there is nothing to observe.

287
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
This came to mind.

288
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
What?

289
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:17,000
I have heard that some call the plants.

290
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:22,000
That they would grow better and that really helps.

291
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:26,000
So they say. Unscientific, though.

292
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:32,000
If you tried, and what kind of music would be suitable for an onion?

293
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:38,000
If it grows into a singing flower, you'd think any music would bring it to life.

294
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Yes, without a doubt. Great, great.

295
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Snuff stick, come on.

296
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:50,000
And don't just sit there. We have work to do.

297
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,000
But Hemuli...

298
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Without you, this will be nothing.

299
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
What sound is that?

300
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:15,000
The snuffbox plays the harmonica on the onion.

301
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
For what the hell?

302
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
I don't know.

303
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:24,000
I guess we should gradually end the visit?

304
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,000
Our gift was a full wolf.

305
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:42,000
They are of no use.

306
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,000
Well, that's what it looks like.

307
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Would you like a cup of tea?

308
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Ah, yes, thank you.

309
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Good idea.

310
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Why didn't calling help?

311
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
The onion should...

312
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Not used!

313
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
No!

314
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
No!

315
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
No!

316
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
No!

317
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
No!

318
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,000
No!

319
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
No!

320
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000
No!

321
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Why didn't calling help?

322
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000
The onion should...

323
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,000
No!

324
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,000
Use!

325
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000
To sprout!

326
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
That hardly works either.

327
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Coming already!

328
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Well, what's happening now?

329
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:39,000
It's no use staring at that onion. It won't budge.

330
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
Shut up.

331
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
I hear something.

332
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
The onion sprouts!

333
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
It's growing.

334
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
Mummy Moomin!

335
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Moominpapa!

336
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
The singing flower has sprouted.

337
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
It has leaves!

338
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,000
Did my lips make my harp do it?

339
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Beyond belief!

340
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:28,000
How can I leave you?

341
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
I'm crazy too.

342
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:37,000
It really does look like it could sing.

343
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
Is that so?

344
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:43,000
It really looks like it could sing.

345
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
You were right.

346
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
That's what we said.

347
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
Nice plant.

348
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,000
Very comfortable.

349
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
Sorry I doubted.

350
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
It felt so incredible.

351
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,000
Even grandma would be surprised by this.

352
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
Oh, I hear.

353
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
Uuuuu...

354
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
I get hungry when I sleep.

355
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
New album.

356
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
Good appetite.

357
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
Uuuuu...

358
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
Uuuuu...

359
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
Hey hey!

360
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
Hey hey!
