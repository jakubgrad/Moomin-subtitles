1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:20,000
The weather was so wonderful that Papa Moomin couldn't concentrate on writing his memoirs.

2
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Good morning, Hemuli. Good morning. Have you found a new plant?

3
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Goats. I've already explored Moomin Valley in detail.

4
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,000
So. I, too, already know every inhabitant of Moomin Valley.

5
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Absolutely.

6
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
how is it Would you like a cup of tea?

7
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Moomin and sell.

8
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
So it seems.

9
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Peeking through a crack in the fence.

10
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
It's an abandoned house.

11
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Moomin, what are you doing?

12
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Hi dad.

13
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
It hasn't been lived in for years.

14
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Someone just moved in there.

15
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Ai.

16
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Shall I take a peek?

17
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Good manners is how cool.

18
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Would the children come to play with us?

19
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Ice. They look so good together.

20
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
I would like to get closer.

21
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:39,000
So do I. They are sitting there in their seats.

22
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
We have to get to the other side of the fence.

23
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,000
How does it work? We can't just march in like that.

24
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Let's go borrow some sugar.

25
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
What is your passion?

26
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
I'll borrow your magnifying glass.

27
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
What's up? Please.

28
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
A bit cheeky.

29
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Dad, what are you going to do?

30
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
You stay here waiting.

31
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,000
If you come along, the whole plan will go to waste.

32
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Dad, what are you up to?

33
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,000
What is that father examining with a magnifying glass?

34
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
I would know.

35
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Mom, there's someone sneaking around.

36
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Goody. What the hell are you guys doing there?

37
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Woe to me for the verse.

38
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
I thought nobody lived here.

39
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
We live. We just moved.

40
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Oh, I'm so sorry. I don't want to intrude.

41
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
So what are you doing here?

42
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
I'm investigating a murderous transportation system.

43
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Is there a similar one for them?

44
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Of course it is. It is fascinating research.

45
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Is there a similar one for them?

46
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Of course it is. It is fascinating to study how they build their way.

47
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:23,000
This right here is the high street of murderers.

48
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
I don't see any regrets.

49
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:31,000
You're not an expert like me.

50
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Otherwise, welcome to mummy valley.

51
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Even though I live somewhat far away, I'm still your closest helper in these matters.

52
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Oh, you're a Moomin dad.

53
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Actually I am. But how do you know that?

54
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Has our reputation already spread that far?

55
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:58,000
We've heard that Moomins are a bit unusual.

56
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Oh, how flattering.

57
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
And you are Mrs...

58
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Vili, Jonkka, mother and housewife.

59
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
How do you do.

60
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Dad seems to have made some new friends for us.

61
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Oh, welcome to the party.

62
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,000
For a long time, we haven't had any good guys.

63
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,000
That's a really good idea, my dear.

64
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:32,000
How else could we show that they are welcome in mummy valley?

65
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:37,000
For my part, I took care of the children's entertainment.

66
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Good. Otherwise Hemuli...

67
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,000
I guess. I have to organize fireworks.

68
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Let's collect a lot of flowers.

69
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
What flowers would you collect?

70
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,000
I know the flowers in the neighborhood.

71
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,000
The kids will probably like this.

72
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,000
If they survive.

73
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,000
They are weird. Remember to behave especially well.

74
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Yes mom.

75
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Luumi-Peikko, take the cookies to the table.

76
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Clear.

77
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
The slide works great.

78
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Good. I'm going to try it.

79
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Name, name, name.

80
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Hey, fingers off, jerk.

81
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
I only took one.

82
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Alert, alert.

83
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Vili whose katraine is approaching.

84
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Oh, oh, oh. The rush came. Please help me decorate.

85
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Let's light up.

86
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Shall the rockets be lit immediately or later?

87
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Later, later. In the end, to shine.

88
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Welcome, Moomin house.

89
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Thank you for the kind invitation.

90
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Come in and make yourself at home.

91
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,000
A very pleasant surprise.

92
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Welcome, Moomin house.

93
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Garbage.

94
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Mom, you look very upset.

95
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Rosebuds should have been sprinkled on the floor, but there were none.

96
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Flowers will stain.

97
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:55,000
No problem. May I introduce our child?

98
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,000
They look very different.

99
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Moomin is the only child of his own.

100
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Others are. The kids will probably have fun.

101
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:12,000
My children don't play. They read and study. Rather.

102
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Really. Are you sure about that?

103
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Of course.

104
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Let's go to the salon. Vili-some people can study other people's play.

105
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Wipe the chair before you sit down.

106
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Yes, mother.

107
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,000
The children have built.

108
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Special furnishings.

109
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:46,000
You really don't want to play anything?

110
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
In.

111
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,000
The slide would do wonders for you.

112
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
No thanks.

113
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,000
No. Absolutely not.

114
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Are you absolutely sure?

115
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Me too.

116
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,000
All the better for us.

117
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Sounds like Moomin.

118
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Beautiful. Beautiful.

119
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,000
A small sale and a pinch.

120
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Yes, your children seem quiet.

121
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:42,000
So. Kind children are seen, but not heard.

122
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,000
That was my child.

123
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
And that was the second one.

124
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,000
We seem to be having fun.

125
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Take a shortbread cereal.

126
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,000
They have a slightly peculiar taste.

127
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Don't worry.

128
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Everyone in turn.

129
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Save my child.

130
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Stop it. It's dangerous.

131
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:30,000
I told you to behave properly.

132
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
You can hurt yourself.

133
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Don't be nervous. I have medicine for my face in my handbag.

134
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Unnatural, Eiti.

135
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Go!

136
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Kids, stop it.

137
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Stop it.

138
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
We're going home.

139
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Time for the end of the glitterati, I guess.

140
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Yes, I was warned.

141
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Would I expose my child to all of this?

142
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Muomilaakso is not a suitable place for children.

143
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
What exactly is this?

144
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Ilo gunfire in your honor.

145
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
What?

146
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,000
I have arranged it for you.

147
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Hello. Come again soon.

148
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Tomorrow.

149
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
It won't even be heard.

150
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,000
I don't think Viljonka enjoys the party.

151
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,000
But her kids enjoyed.

152
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:58,000
I think Viljonka should have lowered himself from the slide.

153
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Adults don't go down slides. They are afraid of looking funny.

154
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Father.

155
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:10,000
I'm so sorry, Granny. I will fix what I have broken.

156
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Dad, what happened?

157
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:17,000
It seems like it's been a long time since I last went down slides.

158
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Now let's make the slide so sturdy that it can withstand Moomin mom.

159
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Me too. Let's do it for mom.

160
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Thanks for the fix. I don't.

161
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:32,000
But remember that we also want to count.

162
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Of course. I'm just trying.

163
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,000
You stay there until I come back.

164
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Did I get out?

165
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
You can study in the yard.

166
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
So what is someone?

167
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:58,000
You can never play with those noisy buckets again.

168
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Mom, where are you going?

169
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:06,000
To find another house. There is a move to Moomin Valley, it was a mistake.

170
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Roa-Vilinjonkka, have a good day.

171
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Stay away from children's activities.

172
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:17,000
What a pity. We were just thinking of going to pick them up.

173
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Curio.

174
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Is anyone there?

175
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
I can.

176
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Is anyone there?

177
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Is anyone there?

178
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Is anyone there?

179
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Is anyone there?

180
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
What?

181
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Stinker.

182
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Please wait.

183
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Good, good.

184
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Good.

185
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Help.

186
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Can't help you anymore.

187
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:23,000
I have a deep chasm and a hungry crocodile.

188
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:26,000
We should have taken Vilionka's children with us.

189
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
What about Vilionkka?

190
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,000
We wouldn't have told him.

191
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Nipsu, did the spirit leave you?

192
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:40,000
No, I knocked the crocodile out when I fell on it and now I'm swimming to shore.

193
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,000
I thought I was going to swim.

194
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Bad catch.

195
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Vilionka's children.

196
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Why don't they come here?

197
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Of course, their mother has forbidden them to be.

198
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
What now?

199
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Hey, why aren't you playing with Moomin and the others?

200
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:18,000
They don't want to play with us.

201
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,000
We can always be one.

202
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,000
What is Haisuli doing there?

203
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,000
I guess you guys don't usually have fun.

204
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,000
No, we want to play too.

205
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Listen, I can show you an even better playground.

206
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Really?

207
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Necessarily.

208
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,000
What would I start lying to you about?

209
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
It's an exciting place.

210
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
It's terribly sad here.

211
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Terribly!

212
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Do you think Moomin won't play with us anymore?

213
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Not sure.

214
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Your brother is right, it is.

215
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Let's go now.

216
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,000
What the heck does Haisuli have in mind?

217
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,000
This is the place I told you about.

218
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Grab the rope and swing yourself to the other side and back.

219
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:14,000
I've never been so into pullovers.

220
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,000
This is the place I was talking about.

221
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Grab the rope and swing yourself to the other side and back.

222
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,000
I've never been so into pullovers.

223
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Scare.

224
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:32,000
What's fun exists without shivering.

225
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Isn't the opposite slope a bit higher?

226
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:41,000
There is. You must raise your thighs.

227
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Who wants to be first?

228
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Let's all go at once.

229
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
All of them?

230
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Then you won't be so scared.

231
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
I don't want to like that.

232
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Oh, you wanna go alone huh?

233
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Go, it's fun.

234
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
Do you dare?

235
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Well, why wouldn't you.

236
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:10,000
I've done the trick hundreds and hundreds of times.

237
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
Show me then, Stinker.

238
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Noni, Toivoteikka.

239
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:17,000
I didn't even know that Stink was made.

240
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Noni, Toivoteikka.

241
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:25,000
I didn't even know that Haisuli is hard to hang on ropes.

242
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Listen, is this your regular place?

243
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Kind of.

244
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Honestly, I don't think I could do the trick myself,

245
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:38,000
if I didn't know you got through it.

246
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Stink, you have to show us.

247
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Jump first, I'll be next.

248
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,000
No, no, you just jump.

249
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:52,000
I have to see with my own eyes how the trick is done.

250
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:57,000
What, you haven't jumped before yourself?

251
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
I am, it's just not fun now.

252
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:03,000
Ha ha, don't bother spoiling other people's joy.

253
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:06,000
We're here ready to clap.

254
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:10,000
Look, Ullias and Urhea Haisuli Tartsan.

255
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Joo.

256
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:15,000
Are you ready, Stingray? Flip it properly.

257
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,000
My hero, Stink, jumps.

258
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Stink, we're waiting.

259
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Power.

260
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Stink, show me.

261
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
Uh...

262
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:50,000
Or you've done this many times, huh?

263
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:54,000
I am, like everyone else.

264
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,000
The trick is impossible.

265
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:00,000
And you knew it, Stink.

266
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
I don't know now.

267
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,000
Follow us, let's go play for real.

268
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Stinky, you play Tartsa and stay as rich as you like.

269
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:15,000
Wait you can leave me here rogue.

270
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
This is unfair.

271
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
A Moomin.

272
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,000
Oh!

273
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,000
The brother whose kids had a blast,

274
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:44,000
and they did not return home until late at night.

275
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
Bye until tomorrow.

276
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
Hello. Hello.

277
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:54,000
Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello.

278
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
Oh, oh, my child.

279
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:02,000
Where have you been? I told you to stay home.

280
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
We were with Moomin.

281
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
Oh, he winged you.

282
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,000
It wasn't quite like that. We...

283
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
Forget that horrible family.

284
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
We will move from here right away.

285
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,000
Oh, we're moving?

286
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
Yeah, get out of here.

287
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:20,000
It is not suitable for those who love order and spotless homes.

288
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
What happened to you now?

289
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
We don't want to change.

290
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
We do want to stay.

291
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
We want to play with Moomin.

292
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
Moomin here is fun and dusty.

293
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:38,000
We want to live in Moomin Valley forever.

294
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,000
Exemplary upbringing, own example.

295
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:45,000
In my experience, children pull the longest rope.

296
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
It's together here.

297
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
It's together here.

298
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
It's together here.

299
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
It's together here.

300
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
It's together here.

301
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
It's together here.

302
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
It's together here.

303
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
It's together here.

304
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
It's together here.

305
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
It's together here.

306
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
It's together here.

307
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
It's together here.

308
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
It's together here.

309
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:16,000
Monta.

310
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:29,000
That's how Vili, who with his three children, became the lively inhabitants of Moomin Valley.
