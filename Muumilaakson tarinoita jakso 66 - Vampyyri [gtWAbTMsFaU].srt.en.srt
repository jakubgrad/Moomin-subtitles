1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
One day a vampire escaped from the zoo.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:12,000
It wasn't the terrible dragon rafts from Transylvania, but still scary.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Everyone was very worried because it is disgusting to be in the teeth of a bloodsucker.

4
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
There isn't. Crazy, not a single picture of a vampire.

5
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Did you look properly?

6
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
I looked.

7
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
It doesn't have all the animals!

8
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Although the name of the book is World Animals.

9
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Then maybe a vampire isn't an animal after all. Is it a plant?

10
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
And ran away!

11
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Maybe Hemuli knows what a vampire looks like.

12
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
There are carnivorous plants.

13
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
A vampire is not a plant!

14
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
It is, if it is not mentioned in the animal book.

15
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
If it's even an object!

16
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Really?

17
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:09,000
You're a fool. If it's escaped from the zoo, then it's obviously an animal.

18
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,000
It probably is, but it would help if you knew what it looks like.

19
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I would mainly like to brush up on my old knowledge with the help of a book. A vampire is a type of bat.

20
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Bat?

21
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Everyone who hears tries to cover themselves to prevent the vampire from biting.

22
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
A harness would be the only safe outfit.

23
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Pidua gets goosebumps when he imagines you in the harness!

24
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
I will not participate in the tournament.

25
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Someone is at the door.

26
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Someone is at the door.

27
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Have you come running on foot?

28
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
I am truly a disaster.

29
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Well, what's so crazy?

30
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Everything is crazy.

31
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:11,000
You must have heard about the vampire who escaped from the zoo?

32
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
With pleasure. What has happened to it?

33
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:18,000
According to the latest information, it may have gone towards Moominvalley.

34
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
The vampire is coming.

35
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
It's entirely possible that it's already here.

36
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Terrible. It's a disaster. What the hell are we doing now?

37
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
We try to protect ourselves from its bite.

38
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Do we need to get protective gear?

39
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
That would be wise. Thanks for the juice.

40
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Does the harness work?

41
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Fine. I didn't know you had one.

42
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Remember to keep the doors and windows tightly closed.

43
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
That is important.

44
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Are you going to catch that vampire?

45
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Oh it is. Professionals will come to the rescue.

46
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
It's quite clear.

47
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
What if I find it?

48
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
You run away.

49
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
The weather had to be caught.

50
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Yeh, yeh. But it can bite you.

51
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
I bite it first and it doesn't do anything.

52
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
I have to move on now.

53
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Keep your eyes open and stay inside.

54
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Goodbye and goodbye.

55
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Thank you for visiting.

56
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
I'm careful you too.

57
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Chief of Police, I'm coming along.

58
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
I see. Stay with me.

59
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Moominpapa said that a vampire looks like a bat.

60
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
I hope we never have to see that.

61
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:37,000
From that night on, the residents of Moomin Valley lived in constant fear of vampires.

62
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:40,000
S IT WAS WRONG

63
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:50,000
Well, no face here?

64
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Let's tie that too.

65
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:52,860
Kumal index

66
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
No, I don't see anything

67
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
The eyes must also be protected.

68
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
No

69
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Now be wise.

70
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,380
What on earth? Is it masquerade?

71
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:06,420
So

72
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:10,420
Vampyyri won't be able to bite Nipsu now.

73
00:04:10,420 --> 00:04:12,420
But how can Nipsu eat?

74
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:19,420
Nipsu says that the vampire has taken away his appetite anyway.

75
00:04:20,420 --> 00:04:23,420
Nipsu says that the windows must be closed.

76
00:04:23,420 --> 00:04:25,420
Ah, the windows are closed.

77
00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:29,420
Oh the horror, the chimneys also have to be blocked.

78
00:04:30,420 --> 00:04:31,420
Hmm.

79
00:04:32,420 --> 00:04:37,420
Nipsu, you're safe inside. Use the bandage only outside.

80
00:04:38,420 --> 00:04:39,420
Shall I untie you?

81
00:04:40,420 --> 00:04:42,420
Oh, they dress you!

82
00:04:43,420 --> 00:04:46,420
Do you dare to go out in bandages?

83
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:49,420
Of course, this is the most secure after the body harness.

84
00:04:49,420 --> 00:04:53,420
I'm not scared, I caught this vampire.

85
00:04:53,420 --> 00:04:54,420
Not without me!

86
00:04:59,420 --> 00:05:00,420
Tel!

87
00:05:17,420 --> 00:05:19,420
Help! The vampire is here!

88
00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:23,420
I bite a vampire!

89
00:05:25,420 --> 00:05:27,420
It's biting me!

90
00:05:28,420 --> 00:05:29,420
Stop it!

91
00:05:29,420 --> 00:05:32,420
Talk to me by pretending to be a jerk!

92
00:05:43,420 --> 00:05:44,420
Good day, Hemuli.

93
00:05:45,420 --> 00:05:47,420
How many days!

94
00:05:47,420 --> 00:05:50,420
Can you see through that net? Seems awkward.

95
00:05:50,420 --> 00:05:54,420
This is inconvenient, but better than getting bitten by a vampire.

96
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:56,420
I wouldn't have believed you.

97
00:05:56,420 --> 00:05:58,420
A vampire bite is dangerous.

98
00:05:59,420 --> 00:06:05,420
I'm not arguing, but I thought you knew that vampires hate garlic.

99
00:06:05,420 --> 00:06:07,420
Is that true?

100
00:06:07,420 --> 00:06:08,420
Let's hope.

101
00:06:08,420 --> 00:06:13,420
Know him. You seem to trust the power of garlic.

102
00:06:13,420 --> 00:06:14,420
Yes.

103
00:06:15,420 --> 00:06:17,420
Well, you can't afford to capsize the boat.

104
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:21,420
Garlic has been used for centuries to ward off vampires.

105
00:06:21,420 --> 00:06:24,420
If only I could get some garlic pearls.

106
00:06:25,420 --> 00:06:26,420
Snuff, Muikkunen.

107
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:29,420
Good day, Hemuli.

108
00:06:29,420 --> 00:06:32,420
Oh, you have garlic around your neck too.

109
00:06:32,420 --> 00:06:34,420
Did you catch the vampire?

110
00:06:34,420 --> 00:06:35,420
Well, not yet.

111
00:06:35,420 --> 00:06:38,420
I don't think there are any vampires.

112
00:06:38,420 --> 00:06:39,420
On, on.

113
00:06:39,420 --> 00:06:42,420
The zoo was here yesterday looking for people.

114
00:06:42,420 --> 00:06:48,420
Everyone here seems to be afraid of vampires. All except the Moomin.

115
00:06:48,420 --> 00:06:51,420
You don't seem scared either?

116
00:06:51,420 --> 00:06:54,420
Maybe not, but the exterior can be deceiving.

117
00:06:54,420 --> 00:06:57,420
Let's stop the fuss and rush after the monster.

118
00:06:57,420 --> 00:06:59,420
Did you hear that, Moomin?

119
00:06:59,420 --> 00:07:00,420
It's fine.

120
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:03,420
How do the locals react?

121
00:07:04,420 --> 00:07:05,420
Who anyway.

122
00:07:05,420 --> 00:07:10,420
Mom is not at all, but dad doesn't stick his nose out at all.

123
00:07:22,420 --> 00:07:23,420
Good day.

124
00:07:23,420 --> 00:07:25,420
Good day, Mrs. Viljonka.

125
00:07:25,420 --> 00:07:30,420
Come in quickly. Moominpa gets alarmed if I keep the door open.

126
00:07:30,420 --> 00:07:32,420
Oh yeah, for heaven's sake.

127
00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:37,420
Hey papa, what if the vampire has taken Mrs. Viljonka's hamo?

128
00:07:37,420 --> 00:07:41,420
No, no. He couldn't have come past the garlic.

129
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:42,420
Oh, right.

130
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:45,420
The date for the vendors has now been decided.

131
00:07:45,420 --> 00:07:47,420
Aha, right?

132
00:07:47,420 --> 00:07:49,420
I hope you are in a generous mood.

133
00:07:49,420 --> 00:07:51,420
I'll be back soon to collect the donations.

134
00:07:51,420 --> 00:07:53,420
We have a lot of useless junk.

135
00:07:53,420 --> 00:07:57,420
Couldn't the sellers wait until the vampire horror is over?

136
00:07:57,420 --> 00:07:59,420
When would that be?

137
00:07:59,420 --> 00:08:05,420
No, no. In times like these, civilian courage is needed and oh Heroa valuables.

138
00:08:05,420 --> 00:08:07,420
So yes.

139
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:09,420
I'm moving on.

140
00:08:09,420 --> 00:08:12,420
You are brave. Use caution.

141
00:08:20,420 --> 00:08:22,420
Hmm.

142
00:08:30,420 --> 00:08:32,420
Oh.

143
00:08:34,420 --> 00:08:36,420
Oh.

144
00:08:36,420 --> 00:08:39,420
You're not a vampire are you?

145
00:08:40,420 --> 00:08:43,420
Share, you are afraid of garlic.

146
00:08:43,420 --> 00:08:45,420
Papa, papa, would you come here?

147
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:47,420
What matter?

148
00:08:47,420 --> 00:08:49,420
What the hell?

149
00:08:49,420 --> 00:08:51,420
The vampire is here.

150
00:08:51,420 --> 00:08:53,420
what did you say

151
00:08:53,420 --> 00:08:55,420
Vaampyri.

152
00:08:55,420 --> 00:08:57,420
Dad, what now?

153
00:08:57,420 --> 00:08:59,420
Mamma, run away.

154
00:08:59,420 --> 00:09:01,420
Here we come.

155
00:09:01,420 --> 00:09:03,420
Vaampyri.

156
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:05,420
Dad, what now?

157
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:07,420
Mamma, run away.

158
00:09:07,420 --> 00:09:09,420
Here we come.

159
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:11,420
Here we come.

160
00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:13,420
Mm.

161
00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:17,420
What is this?

162
00:09:17,420 --> 00:09:19,420
Wow, the vampire is here.

163
00:09:19,420 --> 00:09:21,420
Oh.

164
00:09:25,420 --> 00:09:27,420
Oh.

165
00:09:27,420 --> 00:09:29,420
Mamma.

166
00:09:29,420 --> 00:09:31,420
Is everything okay?

167
00:09:31,420 --> 00:09:33,420
Were you attacked by a vampire?

168
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:35,420
Oh.

169
00:09:37,420 --> 00:09:39,420
Oh.

170
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:41,420
Hmm...

171
00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:48,420
An unusually affectionate vampire.

172
00:09:54,420 --> 00:09:56,420
It tastes like pancakes.

173
00:09:58,420 --> 00:10:00,420
The vampire must be sent away.

174
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:02,420
Cute little faces.

175
00:10:02,420 --> 00:10:06,420
Mom, are you sure the vampire didn't have time to bite you?

176
00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:10,420
Of course not. How would it bite me?

177
00:10:10,420 --> 00:10:14,420
It is out of character to say that a vampire is affectionate.

178
00:10:14,420 --> 00:10:16,420
It's hearty?

179
00:10:16,420 --> 00:10:23,420
I have heard that the victim of a vampire's bite turns into a vampire himself and protects his prey.

180
00:10:23,420 --> 00:10:25,420
Goblin gold.

181
00:10:25,420 --> 00:10:29,420
Do I look like a vampire to you?

182
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:32,420
What are you going to do with a vampire?

183
00:10:32,420 --> 00:10:36,420
Yay, can't it stay in the kitchen?

184
00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:38,420
A vampire?

185
00:10:38,420 --> 00:10:41,420
Yes, it's always warm in the kitchen.

186
00:10:41,420 --> 00:10:43,420
Let's keep it in a jar.

187
00:10:43,420 --> 00:10:45,420
Not all the time.

188
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:49,420
I don't live in a house with a vampire running around on the loose.

189
00:10:49,420 --> 00:10:54,420
You can go outside when the mamma muvi is released from the vampire's glass jar.

190
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:56,420
A vampire is dangerous.

191
00:10:56,420 --> 00:11:01,420
Dad, could it be possible that there are more than one type of vampire?

192
00:11:01,420 --> 00:11:02,420
Ai!

193
00:11:02,420 --> 00:11:04,420
You know, even if this species doesn't bite.

194
00:11:04,420 --> 00:11:07,420
The vampire hasn't bitten any of us yet.

195
00:11:07,420 --> 00:11:09,420
And maybe I won't bite.

196
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:11,420
That's true, but what...

197
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:15,420
I won't give up my little vampire. I won't give up.

198
00:11:16,420 --> 00:11:21,420
Thanks for everything, but I think I'm going home.

199
00:11:26,420 --> 00:11:28,420
Police Chief! Police Chief!

200
00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:31,420
Daytime someone.

201
00:11:31,420 --> 00:11:34,420
Did you catch the vampire?

202
00:11:34,420 --> 00:11:36,420
Who? Me?

203
00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:40,420
The vampire must be caught before the charity sale.

204
00:11:40,420 --> 00:11:41,420
Really.

205
00:11:41,420 --> 00:11:44,420
Look under every single stone.

206
00:11:44,420 --> 00:11:46,420
You can trust me.

207
00:11:46,420 --> 00:11:49,420
Oh God! Oh God!

208
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:55,420
I have to go for a tour.

209
00:11:56,420 --> 00:11:59,420
There is nowhere to stay.

210
00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:12,420
A cute little vampire.

211
00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:14,420
Are you hungry?

212
00:12:16,420 --> 00:12:20,420
Well, let's go see if there's anything in the kitchen.

213
00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:22,420
Mamma!

214
00:12:23,420 --> 00:12:24,420
So what?

215
00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:25,420
Hemul came.

216
00:12:25,420 --> 00:12:28,420
Please invite him in.

217
00:12:28,420 --> 00:12:31,420
Keep him company while I give the vampire some jam.

218
00:12:31,420 --> 00:12:34,420
Hemuli hardly cares to come in.

219
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:36,420
Neither do I, by the way.

220
00:12:36,420 --> 00:12:38,420
Oh, you're stupid.

221
00:12:38,420 --> 00:12:41,420
You can immediately see from the vampire that it didn't bite anyone.

222
00:12:41,420 --> 00:12:44,420
I think we'd rather stay on the porch.

223
00:12:44,420 --> 00:12:46,420
That's good, there's some tea for you.

224
00:12:46,420 --> 00:12:48,420
Thanks mom.

225
00:12:49,420 --> 00:12:50,420
Mother!

226
00:12:50,420 --> 00:12:51,420
Tule!

227
00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:54,420
The lady wants to see a vampire.

228
00:12:54,420 --> 00:12:55,420
Yes, of course.

229
00:12:55,420 --> 00:12:58,420
Oops, where has it gone?

230
00:12:58,420 --> 00:13:01,420
Back to the kitchen I guess.

231
00:13:03,420 --> 00:13:06,420
Oh, how are you doing, little vampire.

232
00:13:13,420 --> 00:13:16,420
So you want to keep the fact that there is a vampire in the Moomin house a secret.

233
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:18,420
Well, that's clear.

234
00:13:18,420 --> 00:13:22,420
They would immediately come to the zoo to get the vampire away.

235
00:13:22,420 --> 00:13:24,420
Wouldn't that be better?

236
00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:27,420
No, we do take care of our guests.

237
00:13:27,420 --> 00:13:34,420
Too bad, everyone in Moomin Valley believes that the vampire is on the loose and that's why they're afraid.

238
00:13:34,420 --> 00:13:38,420
It seems we are at an impasse.

239
00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:40,420
This is a puzzle.

240
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:42,420
Police Chief!

241
00:13:44,420 --> 00:13:46,420
What's wrong with papa now?

242
00:13:46,420 --> 00:13:49,420
Throw the garlic beads off your neck.

243
00:13:49,420 --> 00:13:52,420
We have found the vampire and buried it.

244
00:13:52,420 --> 00:13:54,420
That's just news.

245
00:13:54,420 --> 00:13:55,420
Verily.

246
00:13:55,420 --> 00:13:59,420
You can tell everyone that there is no need to be afraid anymore.

247
00:13:59,420 --> 00:14:01,420
Hurrah!

248
00:14:01,420 --> 00:14:02,420
Hurrah!

249
00:14:02,420 --> 00:14:04,420
Great stuff, Moominvappa.

250
00:14:04,420 --> 00:14:06,420
You are the hero of Moominvalley.

251
00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:10,420
I will arrange for you to be granted a stable.

252
00:14:10,420 --> 00:14:12,420
I don't know that at all.

253
00:14:12,420 --> 00:14:16,420
I export to spread the good news.

254
00:14:36,420 --> 00:14:38,420
There's someone at the door.

255
00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:46,420
Honey, would you hide the vampire?

256
00:14:46,420 --> 00:14:48,420
Of course.

257
00:14:50,420 --> 00:14:54,420
Come on, Trakula, you don't chew socks.

258
00:14:55,420 --> 00:14:58,420
Hello, Viljolka, come in.

259
00:14:58,420 --> 00:15:01,420
Do you have the goods for sale ready?

260
00:15:01,420 --> 00:15:04,420
Children can carry them away right away.

261
00:15:04,420 --> 00:15:07,420
I just put the things together on the table.

262
00:15:07,420 --> 00:15:09,420
Go further.

263
00:15:15,420 --> 00:15:19,420
Great day, I'm going for a walk.

264
00:15:24,420 --> 00:15:27,420
Even if it's a mess, you can't break anything.

265
00:15:27,420 --> 00:15:28,420
No!

266
00:15:29,420 --> 00:15:33,420
Vampire, vampire, where are you?

267
00:15:33,420 --> 00:15:34,420
Dad, what now?

268
00:15:34,420 --> 00:15:36,420
I can't find a vampire.

269
00:15:36,420 --> 00:15:39,420
Father hid it when Viljolka came.

270
00:15:39,420 --> 00:15:41,420
Where did father slip it?

271
00:15:41,420 --> 00:15:44,420
Well, you'll have to ask dad.

272
00:15:44,420 --> 00:15:46,420
But when I can't find my father either.

273
00:15:46,420 --> 00:15:51,420
I'll help. Dad never finds good hiding places.

274
00:15:56,420 --> 00:15:57,420
Not found.

275
00:15:57,420 --> 00:16:01,420
Looks like we'll have to ask dad after all.

276
00:16:04,420 --> 00:16:05,420
Father!

277
00:16:07,420 --> 00:16:09,420
There you are.

278
00:16:09,420 --> 00:16:12,420
Tell me, where have you hidden the vampire?

279
00:16:12,420 --> 00:16:18,420
I put it where those things from this table have been taken.

280
00:16:18,420 --> 00:16:22,420
Viljolka picked them up at charity sellers.

281
00:16:22,420 --> 00:16:24,420
Also the pot with a lid.

282
00:16:24,420 --> 00:16:28,420
So. Oh, there was a vampire.

283
00:16:34,420 --> 00:16:36,420
Did you have to be Hanna?

284
00:16:36,420 --> 00:16:38,420
Come along, Nuuska Muikkunen.

285
00:16:38,420 --> 00:16:39,420
Alone.

286
00:16:41,420 --> 00:16:45,420
One can only hope that the cover is still in place.

287
00:16:45,420 --> 00:16:49,420
All the stuff from you is here.

288
00:16:49,420 --> 00:16:51,420
Oh, there they are.

289
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:53,420
True madam, Viljolka.

290
00:16:53,420 --> 00:16:56,420
I put that pot among the others by mistake.

291
00:16:56,420 --> 00:16:58,420
We want it back.

292
00:16:58,420 --> 00:17:00,420
Share, what's up?

293
00:17:00,420 --> 00:17:03,420
Kastus, it's stored here.

294
00:17:03,420 --> 00:17:05,420
Let's peek inside.

295
00:17:05,420 --> 00:17:07,420
Is there something there?

296
00:17:07,420 --> 00:17:10,420
It's a kitten.

297
00:17:12,420 --> 00:17:14,420
Dad.

298
00:17:14,420 --> 00:17:15,420
Rude.

299
00:17:15,420 --> 00:17:16,420
Nope.

300
00:17:16,420 --> 00:17:19,420
Viljolka, has anyone gone to lift the lid of the pot?

301
00:17:19,420 --> 00:17:22,420
No, not me at least. Children possibly.

302
00:17:22,420 --> 00:17:25,420
It may still be here.

303
00:17:25,420 --> 00:17:28,420
I'll have to look. Does that fit, Viljolka?

304
00:17:28,420 --> 00:17:29,420
Of course.

305
00:17:29,420 --> 00:17:31,420
Let's disperse then.

306
00:17:38,420 --> 00:17:40,420
Dad, it's not here.

307
00:17:40,420 --> 00:17:41,420
Not visible!

308
00:17:41,420 --> 00:17:43,420
I guess it has faded.

309
00:17:43,420 --> 00:17:45,420
I will help you.

310
00:17:45,420 --> 00:17:47,420
The lady doesn't need it.

311
00:17:47,420 --> 00:17:49,420
I will help you in your search.

312
00:17:49,420 --> 00:17:51,420
This is who my house is.

313
00:17:51,420 --> 00:17:53,420
There is no doubt.

314
00:17:53,420 --> 00:17:57,420
If you're looking for a kitten, then why are you all up in arms?

315
00:17:58,420 --> 00:18:02,420
I guess it's best to tell the truth.

316
00:18:03,420 --> 00:18:07,420
We're not looking for a kitten, we're looking for a vampire.

317
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:11,420
And it was already in the pot from you in the summer. Is there a vampire in my house?

318
00:18:11,420 --> 00:18:13,420
We will try to find it.

319
00:18:13,420 --> 00:18:16,420
Today you announced the grave before the vampire.

320
00:18:16,420 --> 00:18:19,420
And even deeper. How do you do anyone?

321
00:18:19,420 --> 00:18:21,420
I'm so sorry.

322
00:18:21,420 --> 00:18:24,420
There it is. Over there, the back of the couch, which...

323
00:18:24,420 --> 00:18:26,420
Where?

324
00:18:28,420 --> 00:18:30,420
Vili whose.

325
00:18:30,420 --> 00:18:32,420
No sweat.

326
00:18:33,420 --> 00:18:35,420
This is not a vampire.

327
00:18:35,420 --> 00:18:37,420
It's just a bat.

328
00:18:37,420 --> 00:18:38,420
Bat?

329
00:18:38,420 --> 00:18:40,420
A regular bat.

330
00:18:40,420 --> 00:18:42,420
Oh.

331
00:18:42,420 --> 00:18:44,420
Are you sure?

332
00:18:44,420 --> 00:18:45,420
Absolutely sure.

333
00:18:45,420 --> 00:18:49,420
I've never seen a vampire, but often bats.

334
00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:51,420
This is a bat.

335
00:18:51,420 --> 00:18:53,420
Joo.

336
00:18:53,420 --> 00:18:57,420
Good day, hold Vili by. Good day.

337
00:18:57,420 --> 00:18:59,420
Are you at home?

338
00:18:59,420 --> 00:19:01,420
Who cares, hoi.

339
00:19:01,420 --> 00:19:03,420
Not at home.

340
00:19:03,420 --> 00:19:05,420
Vili whose.

341
00:19:05,420 --> 00:19:07,420
It was a pity. Come back later.

342
00:19:07,420 --> 00:19:09,420
Good day.

343
00:19:09,420 --> 00:19:11,420
Police Chief.

344
00:19:11,420 --> 00:19:13,420
What are you guys doing here?

345
00:19:13,420 --> 00:19:20,420
We are going to organize a big party with Vili kunnu in honor of the fact that the Moomins wished the vampire away.

346
00:19:20,420 --> 00:19:22,420
Or really a party?

347
00:19:22,420 --> 00:19:24,420
Just join in, Chief Constable.

348
00:19:24,420 --> 00:19:26,420
Feel good.

349
00:19:26,420 --> 00:19:29,420
Actually, I had something for others.

350
00:19:29,420 --> 00:19:34,420
Being nothing, you just say the information that the vampire has been caught.

351
00:19:34,420 --> 00:19:37,420
It was supposed to be dead and buried.

352
00:19:37,420 --> 00:19:39,420
It's true.

353
00:19:39,420 --> 00:19:43,420
Moominpapu clearly said he buried a vampire.

354
00:19:43,420 --> 00:19:46,420
Then there must be two vampires.

355
00:19:46,420 --> 00:19:49,420
No, there's only one missing from the zodiac.

356
00:19:49,420 --> 00:19:51,420
Let's leave the Moomin house right away and ask for an explanation.

357
00:19:51,420 --> 00:19:52,420
Good idea.

358
00:19:52,420 --> 00:19:53,420
Come already.

359
00:19:53,420 --> 00:19:54,420
Let's go right now.

360
00:19:54,420 --> 00:19:56,420
Let's do that.

361
00:20:10,420 --> 00:20:17,420
The Moomins were annoyed about it, and didn't want to start making up explanations about another vampire.

362
00:20:17,420 --> 00:20:22,420
They went ashore and took a long sailing trip.

363
00:20:22,420 --> 00:20:27,420
Maybe another topic of conversation would appear in mummy valley in time.
