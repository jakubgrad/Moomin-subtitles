1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
I'll try, I'll try again.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
hi what are you doing

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Well, how did that happen?

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
The rain is so hard that I can't get the carrots up.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Yes, I'm frozen.

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Experiment with a garden spade.

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
I'm so tough I can't get carrots up.

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Yes, I'm frozen.

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Experiment with a garden spade.

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
No, the ground is frozen solid.

11
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
We left this year's carrots in the ground.

12
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Don't be sad Moomin, Goblin.

13
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
I cook the same soup, which does not need carrots.

14
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
It's just weird.

15
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
The earth shouldn't freeze this early.

16
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
No.

17
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
And so is the biting wind.

18
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
This boggles my mind.

19
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,000
The weather report promises beautiful and warm weather.

20
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Weather reports can no longer be trusted at all.

21
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Dad, what do you think?

22
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Would the carrots come off the ground if you pour some kind of water on their roots?

23
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Hardly worth the trouble.

24
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Share, it will be tough in the winter, I say.

25
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Oh, my goodness.

26
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
What?

27
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
The trees are so beautiful.

28
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Yes, and how many rowan berries.

29
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Not a hard winter for you.

30
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Do you think so?

31
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
I can't say I like winter.

32
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Ugh, the air smells like snow already.

33
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
We are at home.

34
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Mom, we were chopping firewood.

35
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
More is needed.

36
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Lovely scent.

37
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
A pinch.

38
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Yeah, yeah.

39
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Moomin, you bring enough trees inside.

40
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
We carry as much as we can handle.

41
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Roll the carpet like this.

42
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Wake up.

43
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Ooh, now the claves are done.

44
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Gotta get some water.

45
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
The first snow.

46
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Hey, it started snowing.

47
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Oh, how beautiful.

48
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
It will snow thickly.

49
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
A hundred more, more, more, more!

50
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Yes, it rains because it's powder snow.

51
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Bye! A hundred more, more, more!

52
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
A hundred more, a hundred more, hey!

53
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

54
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
It's snowing, it's snowing!

55
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
I think!

56
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
More, more, more, more!

57
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Let's go, like what I did.

58
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
It's raining more, more, more, more!

59
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,000
You don't get snow! You won't get more snow!

60
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
It's time to take a winter break.

61
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
It is.

62
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Honey, would you like some more hot juice?

63
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
No, thank you. I'm going to sleep now.

64
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Oh, have a good winter, mom.

65
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Have a good winter, honey.

66
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Mamma, did you hear the knock?

67
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
I heard. As if there was someone at the door.

68
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Who in which? Go take a look.

69
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Joo.

70
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Yeah, yeah. I'll open it.

71
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Oops, the door is stuck. Peculiar.

72
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Just a moment.

73
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Oh, my heavens. The Moomin house is already buried in snow.

74
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Mother, there's someone here.

75
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Who is that?

76
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Oh, gotta run upstairs to see.

77
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
There's a postman here.

78
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Or a postman?

79
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Special delivery.

80
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Oh, so much snow.

81
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Never seen before!

82
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Thanks. Who can the package be from?

83
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Oh, no sender name. Are you sure it's for us?

84
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
But you're Moomins, aren't you?

85
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Sure, but still...

86
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
So I did my job well.

87
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Goodbye.

88
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Where did the children go?

89
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
I didn't notice.

90
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Lots of snow.

91
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Stay warm inside, you won't catch a cold.

92
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Joo.

93
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,000
It has indeed been pointed out to us.

94
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
But why did it have to be brought here in the middle of the night?

95
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
What do you think? Could it be an early Christmas present?

96
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Ha, maybe a delicious cake.

97
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,000
And it's not! The package has speed skates for me!

98
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Maybe there is a message written inside.

99
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
So yes. Are we opening already?

100
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Open, open!

101
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
What's there?

102
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Oh, there was something moving.

103
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
I saw something flash too.

104
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Something alive.

105
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
What is it?

106
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Let's return the package.

107
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:27,000
The postman came such a long way for us that it is not possible to return it.

108
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Unwrapped and opened the package.

109
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
What if it bites?

110
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Aren't you a coward?

111
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:39,000
It's the Duck. I like Oranges and Fekings.

112
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Where is the Duck?

113
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Hi, who are you?

114
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Soot cup.

115
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Oh, how the same little creature.

116
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Is it about you? I don't trust him at all.

117
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
First time I've seen something like that.

118
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Is there anywhere to eat here? I'm very hungry.

119
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Oh, I'm sorry.

120
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,000
It must have been terrible to be confined in a cramped box.

121
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Little rascal. Moomin Mama gives you food.

122
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
I guess I came up with something.

123
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Oh, boys, he eats a lot.

124
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Good observation from a real big eater.

125
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Can I have more?

126
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Unfortunately, I don't have any more.

127
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Oh well, not then. Thanks for the deal.

128
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Come on, why were you sent here in the mail?

129
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
That was better than my mother.

130
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
What do you mean?

131
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Well, when mom complained that I'm going to make her another nervous wreck.

132
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
What could he mean?

133
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
I don't know. Not yet.

134
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
He couldn't take care of you.

135
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,000
You must have been so naughty that he thought of getting rid of you.

136
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Well, why anyway?

137
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Selling was not a nice word.

138
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Well, I guess I'll live here with you from now on.

139
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,000
At least you don't live with me?

140
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,000
You eat so much that we become beggars, that's for sure.

141
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
I can even speak.

142
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Mom said she can't do anything for me.

143
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Isn't it a mother's duty to raise her children?

144
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Yes, yes, but she's not a good mother.

145
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Mom said she's not a very good mom.

146
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Mother said that he is not even at Kauppia's mother's house.

147
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Or else I'll make you regret it, that's why the day train was born.

148
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
You can be sure that I can do the same.

149
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Don't make threats or I'll bite.

150
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
What are we doing?

151
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
I wouldn't mind caring for a small child again.

152
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
I don't like that little bit at all.

153
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Oh, don't say that. You hurt sales-sensitive feelings.

154
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
If he stays, I'll go.

155
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
What the hell are we doing?

156
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,000
If he is too difficult a child for a mother, then what about us?

157
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
In fact, that's what I'm afraid of too.

158
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Ha, I know an excellent breeder.

159
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Well, I'm leaving now.

160
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Don't get lost in the snow.

161
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
In.

162
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Where are they taking me now?

163
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Viljonkanluo.

164
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:18,000
She is a very nice and busy aunt and has three children of her own.

165
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
I'm used to being a punching bag.

166
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Anna, excuse me. Maybe I can pick you up after the snow has closed.

167
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Yeh, yeh. There's always an excuse.

168
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Next time I want a pillow in a postal package.

169
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Good time, let's double the snow.

170
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Good thing I brought an umbrella.

171
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Who here can say where is east and where is west?

172
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Didn't papa say that a hundred degrees...

173
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
One hundred and eighty.

174
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Exactly. Then let's go in this direction.

175
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Look, we came straight to Viljonka's door.

176
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Just like papa said.

177
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Who is there at this time?

178
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Sorry to bother you. Me here.

179
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Damn mom. The children are already sleeping and I myself was settling down for the night.

180
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,000
What if the kids get sick and catch a cold on a cold night like this?

181
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Oh, oh, sorry. I would like to ask a small favor.

182
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Door closed. Buy warm. In.

183
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
I apologize for the inconvenience.

184
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Wishes for happiness seem to be in place.

185
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
You never know.

186
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:42,000
What? Oh, no, no. Not at all. It's not mine. Under no circumstances.

187
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Good him. Doesn't look like Moominpapa.

188
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Except in the sense that it's thick.

189
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Thick?

190
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Listen, Mummy Moomin. Children should not be stuffed with too much food.

191
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
That came later.

192
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Isn't it?

193
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
At least not in my opinion.

194
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Well, it's none of my business. What is that request?

195
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Yeah, like...

196
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Crazy pants.

197
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Oh, oh.

198
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Are these aunty?

199
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Yeah. I'll put them back right there.

200
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
I guess we must be?

201
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
No.

202
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Oh.

203
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Sorry for bothering you.

204
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Just don't come back.

205
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,000
It can be difficult to deliver him to the sender under these conditions.

206
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
So what do I do?

207
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
What if he was placed?

208
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:47,000
It may be difficult to deliver him to the sender under these conditions.

209
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
So what do I do?

210
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
What if he was placed in an orphanage?

211
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Orphanage.

212
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,000
So. One has just been built here.

213
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Where do I go now? Although it doesn't matter to me.

214
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:12,000
This is crazy. Let's go home. You can live with us.

215
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
But when I'm not liked...

216
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Yes, if you try to be proper.

217
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
I'll try.

218
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,000
The baby got hurt in the snow.

219
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
I had fun inside the backpack.

220
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Nice to hear.

221
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Can't sleep?

222
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:55,000
I'll sing you a lullaby so you can catch your sleep.

223
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Tukutukulanpaitaani, päkäpäkäpäsiäni, päkäpäkäpuskuripäsiäni...

224
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:10,000
I can't sleep when you sing. My mother can sing.

225
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:15,000
I have completely forgotten how to treat small children.

226
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
I whined, whined...

227
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,000
You rock the cradle so I can't sleep.

228
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Looks like I won't be able to hibernate at all this year.

229
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Help! Earthquake, no!

230
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
I knocked myself out.

231
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
What was it?

232
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Good morning, Moomin-Pekko!

233
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
I am Finland.

234
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
I am Finland.

235
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
I am Finland.

236
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Good morning, Moomin-Pekko! Then you sleep soundly.

237
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
What did you do with the saw?

238
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:08,000
I sawed across the foot of the bed. I wanted to see what was inside.

239
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,000
I can't sleep in a three-legged bed.

240
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
What are you doing there?

241
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:29,000
You finally woke up. You know you snore like a pig?

242
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,000
I don't. I never snore, you will learn that.

243
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
You don't know it yourself because you are sleeping.

244
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:40,000
I don't snore. And there are always letters already.

245
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
No use. I can't read.

246
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Regardless, leave my letter alone.

247
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
What are you staring at?

248
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,000
You're sturdy, but not chubby.

249
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
What? Who said that?

250
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Vili-Onkka said to Moomin-Mamma that Miss Niskunnie is quite chubby.

251
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
What does it have to do with Vili-Onka?

252
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Good. After all, you have cookies hidden.

253
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
They are lending cookies.

254
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
No wonder he's gaining weight.

255
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Get out of the room right away, that little moose too. As you already know.

256
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Well, I'm going.

257
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
I'll take it anyway. What now?

258
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Then you won't be lying to anyone about these lending cookies.

259
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
I'll give you one.

260
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
All right.

261
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Gummy Paw, Aren't you sleeping yet?

262
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Moomin Mommy, do you have any secrets?

263
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Oh, secrets. Just a guess.

264
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
What's in this bag?

265
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Soso, it's not appropriate to open other people's handbags.

266
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Nothing is ever fun.

267
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,000
You should go to sleep, baby, it's already very late.

268
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:10,000
The lovely voice is already ringing nicely.

269
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
hey what are you doing

270
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
What do you have in it?

271
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Bank, for coins.

272
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
What are coins?

273
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
What, Don't you know that?

274
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
I don't know.

275
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
In exchange for coins, you can get the things you want.

276
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:32,000
If you have a lot of coins, you can buy sweets and everything to your heart's content.

277
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Oh, and you could already get yourself a lot of everything, right?

278
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Yeah, exactly.

279
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
But don't tell anyone else.

280
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
In.

281
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Hurrah!

282
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Nice to know other people's secrets.

283
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
I hated this cold.

284
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
There's a nightgown in there.

285
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
what are you doing No wonder, it's cold.

286
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
Close the window already.

287
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Yeah, but isn't that a nightgown for the squeamish?

288
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Tu...

289
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:12,000
Ssh, I took a nightgown, because a slob never wears one.

290
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
Ha, but you haven't asked for permission.

291
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
None of your business.

292
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
But don't tell the little girl.

293
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
You will regret it if you do.

294
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Now I know.

295
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Those holy bones have opened their shroud.

296
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
And my heart...

297
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
What is that?

298
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Oh you?

299
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,000
So.

300
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Oh yeah, you were rehearsing some play by yourself.

301
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Joo.

302
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
I want too.

303
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
I don't know.

304
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
And I have no choice.

305
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
I want to play a hero.

306
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
I thought you were a ghost.

307
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Haa, haa, haa.

308
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
It's happening, it's happening.

309
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Listen mummy, a nipsulapa is something that rattles.

310
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000
Joo.

311
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
So, what could it be?

312
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Don't you want to know?

313
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
Not really.

314
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,000
That's good.

315
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
I thus promised not to reveal it.

316
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
Aha, right?

317
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
I understand.

318
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
It just occurred to me that I might as well tell you.

319
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Come on, no, no, no, no, no.

320
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Says nothing.

321
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Nipsu, what's tinkling you got?

322
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Nothing, nothing.

323
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Hi, I hear you.

324
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
Do you have something to share?

325
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
It's not, isn't it.

326
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
At least nothing that concerns me.

327
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
Nipsu, Does he know any of your secrets?

328
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Well, no, of course not.

329
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,000
And nothing about me either.

330
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,000
Well, I guess not then.

331
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
What happened to you?

332
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,000
No.

333
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
There's Hemuli and the police master.

334
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,000
Good evening mummy.

335
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Is dad at home?

336
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,000
Yes, I picked him up.

337
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,000
Thanks.

338
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
It has rained a lot.

339
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:14,000
We should talk in the basement about your plowing.

340
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Fortunately, Grandma doesn't know anything about this.

341
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
Smells strongly of secrets.

342
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Are you sure no one will come into the basement to disturb us?

343
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
Absolutely sure, we can play in peace.

344
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,000
Or card fraud?

345
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:36,000
Apparently, you have already decided how to keep the roads open in winter weather.

346
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
Right, now we mom.

347
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,000
I brought you tea for the meeting.

348
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,000
Yeah, it looks like you're on a break right now.

349
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,000
Hey, good evening grandma.

350
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,000
Right, our meeting is just ending.

351
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,000
What's wrong with you, you haven't eaten all day?

352
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
I've been so excited.

353
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,000
Whence?

354
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
Because I know secrets, I want to tell.

355
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,000
No, no, no, no.

356
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,000
I'm about to crack, I have to tell you.

357
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Please come down from the chandelier.

358
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
No need to persuade, I'll beat him with a brush.

359
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Oh, I can't take it anymore, I'll get really sick if I hold back.

360
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
Niiskunneids have hidden gems.

361
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
In the drawing drawer under the clothes.

362
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,000
Is it?

363
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
And sell, sell and use.

364
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,000
Hey, stop it, stop it right now.

365
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,000
Niiskunneidi's nightgown without permission.

366
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,000
what did you say

367
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
I just borrowed it a bit.

368
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,000
And the pinch has...

369
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,000
Swell!

370
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,000
There are many coins in the tent.

371
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,000
Yes, they do rattle.

372
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:03,000
And Moomin is secretly rehearsing some silly play, very funny.

373
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:12,000
Now that all the secrets have been revealed, you can be yourself again.

374
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,000
Necessarily.

375
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,000
I somehow felt refreshed.

376
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,000
We have been so harassed.

377
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:23,000
Now I don't have to be scared every time he opens his mouth.

378
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:28,000
Yes, today I still brush him with a floor brush.

379
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
Genuine sales talk.

380
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
It's easier when you don't have to be afraid.

381
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,000
I'm leaving.

382
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,000
What for?

383
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,000
I don't want to live in a place where there are no secrets.

384
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
But what about high heels, Pakkanen?

385
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
Lumi doesn't bother me at all.

386
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,000
I'm going on my way now.

387
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,000
Well bye bye.

388
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,000
Are we just going to let him leave us like that?

389
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,000
Of course, enough food now.

390
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,000
Oh well, you stay here.

391
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
But does he have a place to go?

392
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,000
He goes home, to his mother.

393
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,000
Mom has already calmed down her nerves.

394
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:12,000
Mom is overjoyed when she hears about the secrets here.
