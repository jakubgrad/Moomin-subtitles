1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:19,000
The inhabitants of Muunilaakso are quite stable in nature, but sometimes they too come up with new hobbies.

2
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:33,000
It's not that, and neither is that.

3
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Oh!

4
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Hemuli has started watching birds. What will he come up with next?

5
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I see! There it is!

6
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
No, isn't Hemuli over there?

7
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
On.

8
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,000
What the hell is he doing?

9
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Let's find out.

10
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Hemuli, what are you researching?

11
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Just a few bets, and I'm ready.

12
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Oh!

13
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:20,000
That's it!

14
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Oh, now you've cheered on the birds!

15
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Don't you disparage. I am doing a very important survey. It takes me a week to draw one bird.

16
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Only plants interested you before.

17
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:46,000
I've already studied the river Moomin Valley plant. And neither the greenhouse nor the cross-breeding takes up all my time.

18
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:02,000
I don't have guests. That's why it's not cleaned.

19
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Oh brothers!

20
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
How beautiful.

21
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Hemuli, have you drawn all these?

22
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
I am. I am.

23
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:21,000
And it takes a week to draw one of them.

24
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Damn you!

25
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:29,000
There must be many birds that I have never seen.

26
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Necessarily. The south has said to watch. Those vixen chirpers do not give up easily to observe vixen.

27
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
But this drawing is still in progress.

28
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:50,000
You see that bird very rarely. My last observation is from the previous year.

29
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
It has a black mask.

30
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
But it's still beautiful.

31
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Go out into nature and watch the birds. You will be amazed at how much you can see if you borrow this book.

32
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Humdinger!

33
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000
You will meet many interesting species in the forest.

34
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
An unknown flower.

35
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
You can see that a lot when you're not always running.

36
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Time out.

37
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Oh, come and see.

38
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Very strange.

39
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Just like little cups.

40
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Here it is. They are mushrooms.

41
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Mushrooms?

42
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
There are also those like that.

43
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Never mind, let's go see what we can find deeper in the forest.

44
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Yay!

45
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
As a steep wall.

46
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Hello! What is there?

47
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
I can't figure it out.

48
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,000
I think I know what it is. Shall we climb higher?

49
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
No climbing. What if you slope it down?

50
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
You become a hack.

51
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
You're not afraid.

52
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Of course not. Difficult to climb.

53
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Oh, gross.

54
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:29,000
I'll stay here and catch you if you happen to fall.

55
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Now I see it.

56
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
It's a bird's nest.

57
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Oh, are they scared?

58
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,000
They don't. The mother approaches the nest.

59
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
It's that black-faced emulli bastard.

60
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
What are they doing there?

61
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Hi, friends. That it will come down soon?

62
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,000
They might even tell you what's there.

63
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Oh, now what?

64
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Hey, hawk.

65
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Outrage.

66
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Hawk, so many chicks.

67
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Drive the hawk away.

68
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Let me scream.

69
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
A pinch.

70
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Pinch, bird.

71
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
I'll catch it.

72
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
I'll catch that bird.

73
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Oh yeah.

74
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Damn it.

75
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
The hawk is here again.

76
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
It scoops the chicks out of the nest.

77
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Wait you too that robber. Go away.

78
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Don't come any closer.

79
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Oh, took it hard.

80
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
The hawk can.

81
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Oh, took it hard.

82
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
The falcon can return.

83
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,000
We are allowed to take the chicks home.

84
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Ai.

85
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Let's take both the chicks and the mother to the Moomin house.

86
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Oh yeah. Did Nipsu get it?

87
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Nipsu, how was mother?

88
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
I caught it.

89
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,000
But it's chickenpox.

90
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Now that's fine.

91
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
What's wrong?

92
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Oh well. The left wing is broken.

93
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Otherwise, it's healthy.

94
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Nice to hear.

95
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
What about the chicks?

96
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
They look miserable.

97
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
They are hungry.

98
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
I guess so.

99
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Oh, food for them.

100
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
I'll come along.

101
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
And me?

102
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Me too.

103
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Moomin, Do you know what is suitable food?

104
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:46,000
I know. I saw the mother giving the chicks berries.

105
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Pick lots of berries.

106
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

107
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Joo.

108
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Blueberries are rotting blue.

109
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
The chicks ate them.

110
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Mmm, maheita.

111
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Nipsu, wake up and live and eat.

112
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Isn't that enough?

113
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Let's go feed the chicks.

114
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Eat the bird golds.

115
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Wake up.

116
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Strange.

117
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
They're not hungry.

118
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
It sure is.

119
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Ota.

120
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Hello, snuffbox.

121
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Hey, where exactly are you guys going?

122
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
To see Hemulia.

123
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Ai juu

124
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Listen, tell us how to feed reluctant chicks.

125
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Huh? Is that a riddle?

126
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
No.

127
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
We saved the baby birds with hawks.

128
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
No.

129
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Hey.

130
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Hey.

131
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Hey.

132
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Hey.

133
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Hey.

134
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Hey.

135
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Hey.

136
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Hey.

137
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Hey.

138
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:20,640
And when he

139
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:26,000
axis

140
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Hey.

141
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Good attention.

142
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Thanks.

143
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
They move cold.

144
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Hey.

145
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,500
Hemuli!

146
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:34,000
Hemuli!

147
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:36,000
Not at home.

148
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
He could be drawing.

149
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
That's where Hemuli comes from!

150
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
What's wrong now?

151
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
We have a problem.

152
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Glad you came back.

153
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
What do you want from me?

154
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,500
The book, there was no need to return it yet.

155
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:57,000
What? No, no, no, we have other business.

156
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,000
We came to ask you about the baby birds.

157
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Well, what do you want to know?

158
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
However, here are the books.

159
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,000
It's interesting. Thanks.

160
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Can't take it, can't take it.

161
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
What about chicks?

162
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,000
We found a bird you haven't seen in a year.

163
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
That black-faced...

164
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
It can't be true.

165
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Where did you find it?

166
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,000
But it's not in the same place anymore.

167
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,000
On the contrary, yes it is.

168
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
What exactly do you mean?

169
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Well, we have that bird now.

170
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
In the mummy house.

171
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Yes?

172
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Where are they?

173
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Why don't they come back already?

174
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Worrying doesn't help.

175
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Crazy. The mother eats berries full of carbon monoxide, but the boy is not good for it.

176
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
What is it because of?

177
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
I don't know.

178
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
That's crazy.

179
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
They ate when...

180
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
I have it.

181
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
What do you understand?

182
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,000
It's totally normal.

183
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Oh is it?

184
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:09,000
When the chicks are born, they identify with the first creature they see, i.e. the mother.

185
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:14,000
The mother feeds them, and the chicks don't worry about food from the mother.

186
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Yes.

187
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:19,000
What if the Mother can't feed the chicks, so what?

188
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,000
The chicks die quickly of starvation.

189
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
What are we doing?

190
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
I could come up with a solution.

191
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Exploring nature is beneficial.

192
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:32,000
It's more than just Latin names.

193
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:36,000
So you think we can do something to keep the chicks from dying, Hemuli?

194
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
I think.

195
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Huh? It's impossible.

196
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Nothing is impossible if you try.

197
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,000
I'm so much bigger.

198
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Yes, I can see that, but chicks have the brains of a bird.

199
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Hypsu, you're just right for that job.

200
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
You're just saying I'd agree.

201
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Don't be, Höpsu, let's get started, we have a tough job ahead of us.

202
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
How can this be achieved?

203
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
The sound comes from the porch.

204
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Dad, what are you doing?

205
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Finally? Good day, Hemuli.

206
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
What will it become?

207
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Oh, it will. Well, you'll see.

208
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Oh shit.

209
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Fortunately, the mother survived, even though the falconry attacked it.

210
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Well what do you think?

211
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Doesn't it fly for a couple of weeks?

212
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Now.

213
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Ready!

214
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
So what?

215
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Now.

216
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Why don't the chicks eat, even though we give them suitable berries?

217
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
I will explain to you.

218
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Must see to resort to logic.

219
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Maybe the chicks agree to eat, even though the chicks won't.

220
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
To logic.

221
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Maybe the chicks only agree to eat when the mother feeds them.

222
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Tell me what to do then, huh?

223
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Then the one who is witty will figure out a way to look like a mother, right?

224
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
No crazier.

225
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Not so. That's why I've prepared the bird's equipment and agreed that Nipsu will nest in them.

226
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Nipsu, come here.

227
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Don't be shy, Nipsu. Tight, tight.

228
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,000
A special revelation.

229
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:50,000
The chicks don't notice anything.

230
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Well, Nipsu.

231
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Usually the chicks start chirping when the mother comes near.

232
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Nipsu has the brain of a bird.

233
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Dude, try chirping.

234
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
What?

235
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
I said chirp.

236
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
That, that, Nipsulintu.

237
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Chirping and flapping wing movement.

238
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Chirp, chirp, Nipsu.

239
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Great.

240
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Dude, start feeding the chicks.

241
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
No, no, use the cam.

242
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
They eat.

243
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Succeeded.

244
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Boys.

245
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Oh, lovely.

246
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Once the chicks had accepted the strange bird as their mother, it didn't matter who dressed as the bird.

247
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:24,000
The chicks ate and ate.

248
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
The chicks started to grow.

249
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,000
And then of course they ate even more.

250
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Good morning, Snuska-muikkunen.

251
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Shall I berry again?

252
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Gotta go.

253
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
Do you have something to say?

254
00:15:55,000 --> 00:16:02,000
You know, my friend, you know that birds abandon Moomin Valley and fly far away.

255
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
What?

256
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:08,000
The mother will soon be able to fly and it will also be time for the chicks to leave the nest.

257
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Besides, that rare bird only came to nest in Moomin Valley.

258
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:17,000
This is Moominvalley being Moominvalley.

259
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
I know that.

260
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Yes, I knew that.

261
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:54,000
But somehow I didn't want to think about it.

262
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:58,000
We just saved the birds from the hawk's claws.

263
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,000
How could time fly by so fast?

264
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:05,000
I'm sure the chicks can't fly yet.

265
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:12,000
Listen, Do you know why I travel so much?

266
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:17,000
I've been wandering here and there for as long as I can remember.

267
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,000
And I'm not even going to travel.

268
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:25,000
Because that really is my ultimate nature.

269
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Is there?

270
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:34,000
It is, it is never good if you have to act against your own nature.

271
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:39,000
The nature of baby birds is never good.

272
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:45,000
The nature of baby birds pulls them south.

273
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:53,000
Moomin, so don't be too sad when they go and leave you.

274
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:56,000
They have to go.

275
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,000
Yeh, I know.

276
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:04,000
But I'll still be an ape, I'm afraid.

277
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,000
And the moving day came.

278
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Today you will take off.

279
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Is it ready?

280
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
I want to feed them some more.

281
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:29,000
The chicks could have been seen flying away days ago.

282
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:32,000
They have already grown decent wingspans.

283
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:36,000
Come on birds, move your wings.

284
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:42,000
Spread your wings, yes you can.

285
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:52,000
There you go.

286
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,000
Please.

287
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:49,000
How skillfully can they fly?

288
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
Come see us.

289
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
I will gather berries for you.

290
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:56,000
Next time you can give the hawks a ride.

291
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
Goodbye.

292
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:01,000
Take care of yourselves.

293
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:04,000
Goodbye.

294
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:10,000
Moomin felt a little sad.

295
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:14,000
Caring for the birds had been so much fun,

296
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:19,000
that the bird suit was put in storage just in case.
