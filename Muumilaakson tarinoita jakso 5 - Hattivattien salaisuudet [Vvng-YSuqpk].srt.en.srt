1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Finnishness

2
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Dad, the wind seems to be untying the knot.

3
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Indeed. Go secure your knotstick position.

4
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
At the behest of.

5
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,000
A storm had surprised the Moomin family and their friends on Hattivatti Island.

6
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Moominpappa had thought that it was impossible to sail back to Moomin Valley in this weather

7
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,000
and was secretly delighted to be allowed to stay on the island.

8
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:04,000
If the hat water barometer works, it will show when the rain stops.

9
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
It can't last much longer.

10
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Hemuli, I think we should return the barometer to the hats after the rain stops.

11
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I won't give it, and that's all right for those nasty little critters.

12
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
That's what I like about this barometer.

13
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:28,000
But good Hemuli, you found a lot of new rare plants.

14
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Isn't that enough?

15
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Well, I found a few.

16
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:39,000
In particular, I could mention the thirteen stamens and three pistils,

17
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
which I found near the boat.

18
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Oh, Moominpapa!

19
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
What?

20
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
If my memory doesn't fail me this time,

21
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
you told me to tie the boat to a tree.

22
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
That's what I ordered.

23
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Oh, me too.

24
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Oh, oh, oh, my Apolo.

25
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
You didn't tie up the boat, did you?

26
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,000
I think I tied, but, but...

27
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:13,000
If you didn't tie, then only our faded snow will be found on the beach.

28
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
We pushed the boat quite far.

29
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Yes it should be safe.

30
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
I'll go see.

31
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
I'm running, Moomin Pekkil to Vikkela.

32
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,000
I was going to tie the rope when I found this flower.

33
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
So that...

34
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Moomin!

35
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
It was close.

36
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,000
After a while the boat would have gone.

37
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
That's how hemuli.

38
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,000
I couldn't have imagined that the waves would get this high.

39
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Is the water still rising?

40
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
No.

41
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
And the rain is sensitive too.

42
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Are we doomed?

43
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
The boat was fine.

44
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Lovely! Was the mooring rope tied to the tree?

45
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
It was.

46
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
It really was.

47
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Well boy, nice to hear that.

48
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
The rain is already starting to subside.

49
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Oh good.

50
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
The barometer shows 780.

51
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Means beautiful weather.

52
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
And the wind has died down.

53
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
No, the storm is over.

54
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
It's too early to lay the ground.

55
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Taidama to go for a walk.

56
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Too dark to scan the plants.

57
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:13,000
A little stroll triggered excitement.

58
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Me too.

59
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
I need a walk too.

60
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
I'm getting bored.

61
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
I'll come along.

62
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Hey, mummy came back.

63
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
That's where they come from.

64
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Who are they?

65
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Those ghosts.

66
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Hat mats are here.

67
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
That much and everyone is laughing.

68
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:58,000
They have received a new electric charge from the strike of the thunderbolt.

69
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
What are they doing here?

70
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,000
As if they were going to attack us.

71
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
They only want one thing.

72
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
What are you snuffling?

73
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:13,000
I think they have come to get their barometer back.

74
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Well, of course.

75
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
You hear them, mummy.

76
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Please return the barometer to the hat tray.

77
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Yes, but...

78
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,000
All the Hattivats on the island have come here.

79
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,000
The situation seems somewhat serious.

80
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Emu was good.

81
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Go give it.

82
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
That...

83
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
All right.

84
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Dad, I'll take it.

85
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Good boy.

86
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Be careful.

87
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Don't worry.

88
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Granny is brave.

89
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Here's your stupid barometer.

90
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
I came...

91
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
To restore it.

92
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Here's your stupid barometer.

93
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
I came...

94
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
To restore it.

95
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
I came...

96
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
To restore it.

97
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Grandma's brat!

98
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Grandma's brat!

99
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Grandma's brat!

100
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Are you OK?

101
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,000
I believe so. Luckily we don't have electricity in granny valley.

102
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
My Hero Pole.

103
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Leave the old lady alone.

104
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
are you well

105
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
You look kind of weird.

106
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Nothing bothers me.

107
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Just a joke.

108
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Strange smell.

109
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
What now?

110
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Your hair.

111
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Oh, that's strange.

112
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
You are my hair.

113
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Oh, bald for me.

114
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Oh, my own mother.

115
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
My own mom.

116
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Suddenly a mirror.

117
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Good wonder those hats.

118
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Oh.

119
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Where did I put that mirror?

120
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Oh no.

121
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
You're my hair and you're back in the woods.

122
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Here is a mirror.

123
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
I'm a cool head rat.

124
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
I have to wear a hat.

125
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Or turpania.

126
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Massage oil into your scalp.

127
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
You will grow curls.

128
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
I don't want curls.

129
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Now everyone can see my discount status.

130
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Let's get to the bottom of it all.

131
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:18,000
I've always really liked bald girls.

132
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Don't them.

133
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Finally, those disgusting creatures left.

134
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:32,000
What's wrong with the swamp lady now?

135
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
My hair.

136
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
My beautiful hair.

137
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
My hair.

138
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
My hair.

139
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
You still have time if you get up now.

140
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Where can they go?

141
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Probably to an island.

142
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Which no one has the slightest idea about.

143
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
They are really nice.

144
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
I'm not the greatest.

145
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
I'm fine.

146
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
I'm fine.

147
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
I'm fine.

148
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
I'm fine.

149
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
I'm fine.

150
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,000
They are truly special.

151
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:45,000
No more special than us in their eyes.

152
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:00,000
I would have liked to see the hat mats. Why didn't you wake up?

153
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,000
You were fast asleep. You snored right.

154
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Hi, I'm snoring. I never snore.

155
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
You don't.

156
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,000
I don't want to see hatties.

157
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Same words.

158
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,000
The scarf really suits your features.

159
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
And the color is mine too.

160
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Mom, I want to go on a research trip.

161
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Good idea.

162
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:26,000
The day is perfect for one.

163
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:30,000
The storm may have blown a lot of stuff onto the beach.

164
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,000
We could go explore the other side of the island.

165
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Let's go. New plants can be found there.

166
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Hemuli is already coming to hemuli.

167
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
We can't make any progress.

168
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Don't worry about me.

169
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
I found solid flowers.

170
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Well, we're going already.

171
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Very exciting.

172
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Believe it or not, after a storm like that, we can find anything.

173
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Although sunken treasures.

174
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Such sunken treasures, perhaps, that remain on the surface.

175
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:26,000
I will find treasures if there are any.

176
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Stop it.

177
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
What a lot of stuff.

178
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Look at the box.

179
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
This is too low.

180
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Great box.

181
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
What's inside it?

182
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
It's empty.

183
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Come, come, come.

184
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Retail.

185
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
What now?

186
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Look how beautiful these shoes are.

187
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Later.

188
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
I'm looking for sunken treasures.

189
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Hey, what's that?

190
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Uno...

191
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Uno...

192
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
How wonderful.

193
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:33,000
These look beautiful mummified at the edge of a rose bed.

194
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
What is there?

195
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
I can't find anything.

196
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Don't freak out.

197
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Be more specific.

198
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Hey, niskuneiti.

199
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
I found it.

200
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
I found it.

201
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
I found a real treasure.

202
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
Look.

203
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
It might snow there.

204
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
I found it in a small cave.

205
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
How beautiful.

206
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
What is that?

207
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
A telescope from some ship.

208
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
I'll give it to dad.

209
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
He is delighted.

210
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Hey, better than my treasure.

211
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Come see what I found.

212
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
You have to see this.

213
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
So what is it?

214
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Daredevil, where is your find?

215
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
She's a big woman.

216
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Is he dead?

217
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
He hasn't even been alive.

218
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
It's a picture of the bow of the ship.

219
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
A real queen.

220
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
I guess so.

221
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Even though it doesn't have a back.

222
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Beautiful.

223
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Let's attach it to the bow of our boat.

224
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
It's too big.

225
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
It comes from an ocean liner.

226
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Which sank.

227
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
I guess so.

228
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Please help.

229
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
She has to take it home.

230
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
What do you do with it?

231
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Make people afraid.

232
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
It's hemul again.

233
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
I guess there aren't any more hatties.

234
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Come help!

235
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Let's come.

236
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Do you like that wooden queen?

237
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
The back of the bridge is missing.

238
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Look now.

239
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
No problem.

240
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
What's so great about that?

241
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
The eyes?

242
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Don't do it.

243
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
I'd give you my hair.

244
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Joo.

245
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Yes, of course.

246
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
When I have lost mine so.

247
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Just a little last touch.

248
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
You weigh quite a bit.

249
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Thanks.

250
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
No doubt you played to your heart's content.

251
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
How did you fall into a rock crevice?

252
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
It's a mystery.

253
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
I looked for a tumor and then I saw humps.

254
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Listen to hemul.

255
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
You would have just collected stamps.

256
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Where is it?

257
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Where?

258
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
What's missing?

259
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
What's gone?

260
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
May I be protected.

261
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
Well, I'll tell you now.

262
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
What's wrong?

263
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
My plant collection box.

264
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
Oh good unusual.

265
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Just don't say you put it down.

266
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
That's exactly what I'm trying to say.

267
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Oh good time.

268
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
Oh good time.

269
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
Are you really going to pick it up for me?

270
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
You need to calm down.

271
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Great.

272
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:32,000
It rewarded you handsomely.

273
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:36,000
You will receive one of my precious rarities.

274
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
Well, thank you, thank you.

275
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Where is Moomin?

276
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
That's where you come from.

277
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000
What have you been up to?

278
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:50,000
He's just been staring at that wooden woman.

279
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
He can't see anything else.

280
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,000
Really?

281
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
Not true.

282
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
But that woman is beautiful.

283
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
But remember it's just wood.

284
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
will you help me

285
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
So what's the matter?

286
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,000
Hemuli lost his plant collection box in that gap.

287
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
It wasn't like that.

288
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:12,000
I fell and then the box somehow got stuck.

289
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
You must have a bad memory.

290
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
And I'm not.

291
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:20,000
I also remember the Latin name of the river plant.

292
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
Now go down.

293
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
Will you help me climb up?

294
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,000
That's fine.

295
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
I'll help too.

296
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,000
Be careful.

297
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Is it there?

298
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
I'm not down yet.

299
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
Yeah, I understand.

300
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,000
Here it is.

301
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,000
Great.

302
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
Are the plants intact?

303
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
See for yourself.

304
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
What are you snuffling?

305
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
Please wait.

306
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
I found something.

307
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,000
Exciting!

308
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
Our spring arrives!

309
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
Hohohoi!

310
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
Gold.

311
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,000
Moominpappa and Moominamma came!

312
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:18,000
Get a Moominpa golden vein!

313
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Share, yes, Moominpappa might be surprised now.

314
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:27,000
Papa, what are you going to do with all this gold?

315
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:32,000
It is so beautiful that it would be a shame to hide it in a dresser.

316
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:37,000
Why not sprinkle gold around the rose bed?

317
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:41,000
Big chunky crumbs look lucky.

318
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:58,000
Some see only a silly legless doll.

319
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
You can hold my glass ball.

320
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
No thanks.

321
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:06,000
In that case, I'll keep it for you!

322
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:17,000
The people of Moomin Valley decided never to get maps or sea charts.

323
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:20,000
It's much more interesting without them.

324
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
Thanks.
