1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Mymmeli is a real lust cleaner.

2
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Sometimes Mymmeli cleans the Moomin house too.

3
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
As a thank you to grandma when she takes care of the small sale.

4
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Oh thank you Mymmeli.

5
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:42,000
It can't last, oh I enjoy it so much when I get to do a proper Big cleaning.

6
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
You will still be an excellent family mother.

7
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Well, mothers don't have enough time to clean.

8
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Why wouldn't it be? Don't screw up. Do you have a crush?

9
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Oh well.

10
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
There is now one potential groom here.

11
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Who will come from there? Oh police chief.

12
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
He sells the day. Sister, it's here.

13
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Did you come all the way because of him?

14
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Don't be stupid. I came in the capacity of police chief, in an important position.

15
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Ah, so you came to arrest Mymmel.

16
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,000
No, no, no. Can I see Mymmel?

17
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Why do you want to see Mymmel?

18
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Here's how.

19
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Well, where did I put it?

20
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Here it is.

21
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Sarmus.

22
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Diamond charm.

23
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Oh, the charm I found and brought to the police station.

24
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Sure enough. And since the law dictates we half a year gone,

25
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,000
without the owner showing up, the ring goes to the finder.

26
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Is this Mymmelin?

27
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Oh, is Diamond into me now?

28
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
On, on.

29
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Police Chief.

30
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
And, what?

31
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
You looked like an engaged couple.

32
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Oh, and please.

33
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Ha, the police master blushed.

34
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Oh, boys, what a luscious Diamond.

35
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Shit, don't.

36
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Nipsu, give me the ring.

37
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Hmm, let's see. Big as what.

38
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Is it glass?

39
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
No, glass doesn't sparkle like that.

40
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Hey, show me.

41
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
And will Niisku be asked to watch it?

42
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
He can tell if it is a genuine Diamond.

43
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Apparently glass.

44
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Oh dear.

45
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000
A scientist must stick to the truth.

46
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,000
On the other hand, I wouldn't want to disappoint Mymmel.

47
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Well, what is it?

48
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Did you find out?

49
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Look, Mymmeli.

50
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Hatch, look.

51
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Look, Mymmeli.

52
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Look, Mymmeli.

53
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Look, Mymmeli.

54
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Did you find out?

55
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Look, Mymmeli.

56
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Glass doesn't cut glass, but Diamond does.

57
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
That's right, Diamond.

58
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Fifty carats.

59
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Diamond?

60
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,000
What will happen to my fifty carat Diamond?

61
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Let the municipality take care of it.

62
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:13,000
This looks like glass, but it's actually plastic that can be cut with glass.

63
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Hi, Are you going to keep it tied all the time?

64
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:24,000
If you got a nice diamond and want to show it off, let everyone see it.

65
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Mimmel!

66
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Good day, Hemuli.

67
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Grow up, Mymmeli.

68
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Is something bothering you?

69
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Don't you see?

70
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Of course I see. Have you hurt your hand?

71
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Nothing is too much trouble, see how Dimantti shines.

72
00:04:54,000 --> 00:05:01,000
But it's just a rock. I'm interested in flora. Rocks are boring.

73
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
That's right, Diamond.

74
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
It's coal, just like heating coal.

75
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,000
They say experts are boring.

76
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Good day, Uskamuikkunen.

77
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Grew up, hello Mymmeli.

78
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
You have made your decision.

79
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
What decision?

80
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,000
You're married, ring naming.

81
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Here, naming the ring.

82
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Naming the ring.

83
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Naming the ring.

84
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:48,000
You noticed it, the ring. That's what Diamond says.

85
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
You can see that.

86
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Indeed, 50 carats. Impossibly valuable. Take a closer look.

87
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Thanks. I already saw it.

88
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,000
If I close my eyes, I can see it in my mind.

89
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,000
It will never fade from my memory.

90
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
That's it, got it.

91
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Well, men don't understand the delicate aspects of life.

92
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
It's a known fact.

93
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Vili, who understands.

94
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Vili, who understands.

95
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Vili, who understands.

96
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Vili, who understands.

97
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Vili, who understands.

98
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Vili, who understands.

99
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Hey, come look at that auntie's ring.

100
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
You are a Diamond.

101
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Yes, it's nice.

102
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Mother, here is an aunt with a diamond ring.

103
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
The diamond is bigger than you.

104
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Bigger?

105
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Many times bigger.

106
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Bigger?

107
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Kars Mymbeli?

108
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Good day.

109
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:13,000
I happened to pass by and thought I'd stop for a little chat.

110
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Go inside. It was good.

111
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Oh, if it's okay to open up.

112
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Mymbeli is good.

113
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Oh, what a lovely scent.

114
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Oh.

115
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
A delightful stone.

116
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
A good big maybe.

117
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Oh yeah, it's a fifty carat Diamond.

118
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Oh, it's very pretty, but...

119
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
But, but what?

120
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:00,000
It's strange, but too big Dimantti is popular.

121
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Popular and not...

122
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Yes, yes, Tuomainen Diamond suits the duchess, but they come to you.

123
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,000
It doesn't fit my dress code.

124
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,000
I hope you don't misunderstand me.

125
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Of course not.

126
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Thanks for the tea.

127
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Ignore my words.

128
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
I don't. Let's see.

129
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Some imagine they are something as soon as they happen to own a large Diamond.

130
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
True it is.

131
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,000
The old dress didn't ring Dimantti.

132
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Mymbeli, what are you doing?

133
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Admiring himself in Diamond Finger.

134
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:54,000
I need to get a new suit that fits Diamond better.

135
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Then nobody knows you.

136
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Or even a Lenin fit for a duchess?

137
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,000
After all, I have a few silk aprons.

138
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Please help me mom, please help me.

139
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Let's see.

140
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Good day.

141
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Hello Diamond.

142
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Good day.

143
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Good!

144
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Mimmeli came.

145
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
He looks nothing like Mimmel.

146
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Mimmeli, I think you took me too literally.

147
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
How should it have been?

148
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Nice suit, although the isthmus is strange and the movement maybe...

149
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Is there anything else?

150
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Yes, your whole life should be in harmony with the Diamond.

151
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
My whole life?

152
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
So.

153
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
I have to be.

154
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
I have to be.

155
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
I have to be.

156
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
I have to be.

157
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
I have to be.

158
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
I have to be.

159
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
I have to be.

160
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
I have to be.

161
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Push it!

162
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
I have to be.

163
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:36,600
Mimmeli, are you lucky ع demonsta cou

164
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:38,500
mahduin mm.

165
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:42,500
Oh, or you, Stinker. What do you want from me?

166
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:46,500
What's up with that fine Diamond?

167
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:50,500
I know one house where it would fit.

168
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:54,500
The house is located in the darkness of the forest.

169
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:58,500
No one lives there.

170
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:02,500
It's so dark here.

171
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:04,500
Don't worry.

172
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:08,500
Now you realize why no one else knows about this house.

173
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:17,500
Here we are.

174
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:28,500
It seems to be an old house.

175
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:32,500
Yes, but handsome, just what you need.

176
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:36,500
Oh, oh, oh.

177
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:44,500
Look, Takka. They don't do that nowadays.

178
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:46,500
Phooey.

179
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:50,500
Brother, who turns green with envy, I'll give you the whole house.

180
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:52,500
Oh, thank you.

181
00:11:54,500 --> 00:12:00,500
The fireplace seems to be the only nice touch. Everything else looks rotten.

182
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:02,500
Are you having fun?

183
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:09,500
That you had to find that ring.

184
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:11,500
Treats wipe.

185
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:13,500
Tabeting is a big job.

186
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:17,500
But then we lead the 50 carat life.

187
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:20,500
You can want that kind of life.

188
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:22,500
I'm not sure about myself.

189
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:26,500
If you want me, you can keep the ring on Mondays.

190
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:28,500
It won't stay off my finger.

191
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:30,500
Well, put it on a necklace.

192
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:32,500
I don't like mowing.

193
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:39,500
Oh wonder. I didn't know anything about this castle.

194
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:42,500
This is the real duchess castle.

195
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:44,500
But so spacious that you will drown here.

196
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:48,500
Yes, it's a bit big for me.

197
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:50,500
I change my mind very well here.

198
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:54,500
The posh, posh life is not for you.

199
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:56,500
Sell, don't interfere with this.

200
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:58,500
I can speak my mind.

201
00:12:58,500 --> 00:12:59,500
Lopetta of that, Hand.

202
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:01,500
Neat now.

203
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:03,500
Head over there, madam.

204
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:05,500
Duchess of the castle.

205
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:10,500
Mymmel's new apartment.

206
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:14,500
Hey, that looks pretty cool.

207
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:16,500
Did you hear what I said?

208
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:19,500
This is not possible.

209
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:27,500
Mymmelin is delicious.

210
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:31,500
Mymmelin, hey, you're getting a guest.

211
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:35,500
Good morning, Mymmeli.

212
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:37,500
Good morning, dear lady.

213
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:40,500
Kind to come from such a long distance.

214
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:42,500
It is such a spacious kitchen.

215
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:43,500
Everything is spacious.

216
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:46,500
Looks like you're doing the dishes.

217
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:47,500
I am.

218
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:49,500
We just had lunch.

219
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:54,500
That's right, duchesses eat too, but they don't do the dishes.

220
00:13:54,500 --> 00:14:01,500
If you absolutely want to wear a big diamond, you have to live up to it.

221
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:03,500
How is it going?

222
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:05,500
Get the Maid.

223
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:06,500
Servant girl?

224
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:07,500
What?

225
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:09,500
I enjoy housework.

226
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:10,500
Summer mustaches.

227
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:14,500
Duchesses are for enjoying themselves.

228
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:18,500
A maid is absolutely necessary, absolutely necessary.

229
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:26,500
Mimmel.

230
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:28,500
Nice to see you.

231
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:30,500
What now? Show off.

232
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:32,500
I have a maid.

233
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:33,500
What?

234
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:35,500
Isn't it valid?

235
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:39,500
Oh, too worthy. There is nothing left for me to do.

236
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:47,500
It has a nifty Maid.

237
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:56,500
Is there a thief?

238
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:00,500
Gotta go check it out.

239
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:27,500
Who there?

240
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:30,500
Mrs.

241
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:33,500
What is the lady doing here in the middle of the night?

242
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:34,500
See what...

243
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:35,500
Or so.

244
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:39,500
Didn't I wash the dishes after dinner?

245
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:40,500
Yes.

246
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:43,500
I just have to get myself to do something.

247
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:44,500
Yes.

248
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:46,500
Is my job not good enough?

249
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:49,500
The dishes have never been so clean.

250
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:52,500
But when I couldn't sleep and there was nothing.

251
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:53,500
Just like that.

252
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:57,500
Ma'am, yes I notice when my work is not appreciated.

253
00:15:57,500 --> 00:16:00,500
I will understand when I am no longer needed.

254
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:02,500
No! Wait!

255
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:12,500
Madam, we are in Pula.

256
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:13,500
How so?

257
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:15,500
It's raining there now.

258
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:17,500
So outside?

259
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:21,500
Oh, it's raining my beautiful mate.

260
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:23,500
Mymmeli, it's raining inside.

261
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:26,500
I need a rain shadow over the year.

262
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:33,500
Nobody remembered to fix the roof.

263
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:34,500
Let it rain.

264
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:37,500
I've screwed everyone over.

265
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:51,500
I'm really starting to worry about Mymmel.

266
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:54,500
That guy is no longer himself.

267
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:57,500
It's all because of that stupid tip.

268
00:16:57,500 --> 00:16:59,500
Why did Mymmeli find it?

269
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:01,500
It would be a relief if he lost it.

270
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:03,500
I can screw it up.

271
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:05,500
I don't think that would be appropriate.

272
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:08,500
What can we do?

273
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:10,500
Goodbye, Madam.

274
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:16,500
Where did he go?

275
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:20,500
Listen, Mymmeli. They are going to steal.

276
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:22,500
It's your Diamond.

277
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:23,500
Who?

278
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:25,500
I'm not a language watcher.

279
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:35,500
The diamond must be hidden somewhere.

280
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:37,500
No one can take a look.

281
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:42,500
I plant flowers as a sign.

282
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:48,500
Mimmel.

283
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:00,500
Snuff Muikkunen!

284
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:02,500
Nuuska Muikkunen, what are you doing here?

285
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:04,500
I picked mushrooms.

286
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:06,500
Snuff Muikkunen!

287
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:08,500
Hi, where are you going?

288
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:10,500
To see Mymmel.

289
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:12,500
Yes, it was a very sad day,

290
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:15,500
when Mymmeli found that 50 carat Diamond.

291
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:18,500
Let's face it, it's not Diamond.

292
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:20,500
I only said that to please Mymmel.

293
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:22,500
Stone is glass.

294
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:24,500
I guess I did it wrong.

295
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:28,500
Now let's go see Mymmel.

296
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:41,500
Mysterious! why are you crying

297
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:44,500
Is my Diamond lit yet?

298
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:47,500
Don't cry, you're better off without it.

299
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:50,500
Apart from that, Diamond was just glass.

300
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:53,500
I'm sorry, I shouldn't have lied.

301
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:56,500
Do you lie now so I don't mourn?

302
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:58,500
I do know.

303
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:02,500
I won't lie, the piece of glass I cut was actually plastic.

304
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:06,500
Mymmeli, give me the ring and I'll prove it.

305
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:09,500
Well, I can't, when the ring is illuminated.

306
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:11,500
Then I can't testify.

307
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:13,500
I have the ring.

308
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:19,500
Oh my Diamond.

309
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:21,500
Did you steal it?

310
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:23,500
I hid it in a bun.

311
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:26,500
I just found the ring lying on the ground.

312
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:30,500
I know who the thief is, come forward!

313
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:41,500
My ring!

314
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:43,500
Catch the thief!

315
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:45,500
Let it go.

316
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:51,500
I believe in the tide, you don't need to prove anything to me.

317
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:53,500
Are you absolutely sure?

318
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:57,500
I am. Antatati keeps the ring, so I can.

319
00:19:57,500 --> 00:19:59,500
You can what?

320
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:01,500
To be my equal.

321
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:11,500
Oh!

322
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:17,500
Diamond! Diamond!

323
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:19,500
Stink, what are you doing at Timanti?

324
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:21,500
Is that Mymmel's ring?

325
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:23,500
Would you stop it?

326
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:25,500
Onata! Onata!

327
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:33,500
Mymmeli was able to move out of the leaky castle and was able to wear an old, comfortable dress.
