1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,660
T vessel

2
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:29,380
Oh, sorry Moomin mom.

3
00:00:29,380 --> 00:00:31,380
We were clumsy.

4
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:33,380
Eh, that's okay.

5
00:00:33,380 --> 00:00:35,380
Oh, this fell.

6
00:00:35,380 --> 00:00:37,380
Thanks.

7
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:39,380
Are you going out?

8
00:00:39,380 --> 00:00:41,380
Yeah, now that the mark is gone.

9
00:00:41,380 --> 00:00:43,380
Have fun.

10
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:51,380
Tiuhtia viuhti really seem to have settled into the Moomin house.

11
00:00:51,380 --> 00:00:55,380
They are very small and the only ones that can be searched

12
00:00:55,380 --> 00:00:57,380
pencils dropped between the floor wires.

13
00:01:03,380 --> 00:01:05,380
Hey, this looks like a particularly secret place.

14
00:01:05,380 --> 00:01:07,380
Yeah, no one can find here.

15
00:01:09,380 --> 00:01:11,380
Let's go get the suitcase here.

16
00:01:11,380 --> 00:01:13,380
Let's get it here.

17
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:15,380
Are you sure we could keep it in our own room?

18
00:01:17,380 --> 00:01:19,380
What if someone enters the room while we are gone?

19
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:21,380
So what?

20
00:01:21,380 --> 00:01:23,380
Moomins don't go there to hang out.

21
00:01:23,380 --> 00:01:25,380
They are nice.

22
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:27,380
Yes, but strangers.

23
00:01:27,380 --> 00:01:29,380
After all, Moomins let anyone in.

24
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:31,380
Anyone.

25
00:01:33,380 --> 00:01:35,380
Do not go to press!

26
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:39,380
You lied to me.

27
00:01:39,380 --> 00:01:41,380
How so?

28
00:01:41,380 --> 00:01:43,380
Moomin still has it.

29
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:45,380
Even the shoe I gave you.

30
00:01:45,380 --> 00:01:47,380
Out!

31
00:01:47,380 --> 00:01:49,380
Moominma gave it to the grunt.

32
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:51,380
I saw.

33
00:01:51,380 --> 00:01:53,380
I saw the shoe in Moomin.

34
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:55,380
But was it the same shoe?

35
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:57,380
Of course.

36
00:01:57,380 --> 00:01:59,380
I guess I know that.

37
00:01:59,380 --> 00:02:01,380
Oh yours!

38
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:03,380
Momma Moomin did give it to the grunt.

39
00:02:03,380 --> 00:02:05,380
I'm going to see Moomin immediately.

40
00:02:05,380 --> 00:02:07,380
are you coming

41
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:09,380
I'm coming, I'm coming.

42
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:11,380
The truth must be dug out.

43
00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:13,380
Let's dig.

44
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:15,380
The story seems strange at the time.

45
00:02:15,380 --> 00:02:17,380
True.

46
00:02:17,380 --> 00:02:19,380
Mymmeli and I went to the beach yesterday.

47
00:02:19,380 --> 00:02:21,380
So what?

48
00:02:21,380 --> 00:02:23,380
We found an exciting object.

49
00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:25,380
Remember that wreckage we found after the storm?

50
00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:27,380
Of course.

51
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:29,380
It's only been a few weeks.

52
00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:31,380
And remember that wooden sculpture,

53
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:33,380
whose snuff Muikkunen found.

54
00:02:33,380 --> 00:02:35,380
I remember.

55
00:02:35,380 --> 00:02:37,380
Moomin fell in love with it.

56
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:39,380
Don't remind me about it.

57
00:02:39,380 --> 00:02:41,380
It's here now.

58
00:02:41,380 --> 00:02:43,380
And it isn't.

59
00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:45,380
Remember, I'm talking today.

60
00:02:45,380 --> 00:02:47,380
Alone, my own truth.

61
00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:51,380
It was nothing but a stone now.

62
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:53,380
It is as beautiful as before.

63
00:02:55,380 --> 00:02:57,380
Are you sure it's the same?

64
00:02:57,380 --> 00:02:59,380
It is, of course.

65
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:01,380
Beautify Rilma's legs and rear.

66
00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:03,380
True.

67
00:03:03,380 --> 00:03:05,380
Only the legs are a wooden doll.

68
00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:07,380
Beautiful girl with big eyes.

69
00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:09,380
The Moomin licks at it.

70
00:03:11,380 --> 00:03:13,380
Is it still on the beach?

71
00:03:13,380 --> 00:03:15,380
I fancy.

72
00:03:15,380 --> 00:03:17,380
Unless no one has found it.

73
00:03:17,380 --> 00:03:19,380
Sell, do you believe that

74
00:03:19,380 --> 00:03:21,380
the waves shout it away?

75
00:03:21,380 --> 00:03:23,380
I don't know.

76
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:25,380
The waves just hit the beach.

77
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:27,380
If Moomin spots the statue,

78
00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:29,380
he saves it.

79
00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:31,380
And not placing it in the room.

80
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:35,380
Can't fit through the door.

81
00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:37,380
He faked it with some kind of construction.

82
00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:39,380
Yes, I know that.

83
00:03:39,380 --> 00:03:41,140
Oh well.

84
00:03:41,140 --> 00:03:43,140
I can't predict that.

85
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:47,140
He is sitting and supporting some statue, a silly expression on his face.

86
00:03:47,140 --> 00:03:48,140
Sweet!

87
00:03:48,140 --> 00:03:52,140
Disku, Miss, Weren't you on your way to the Moomin House?

88
00:03:52,140 --> 00:03:55,140
I was, but I just remembered one important thing.

89
00:03:59,140 --> 00:04:01,140
The way is clear.

90
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:03,140
Bye!

91
00:04:11,140 --> 00:04:13,140
You're not going to leave either.

92
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:15,140
No, we just...

93
00:04:16,140 --> 00:04:18,140
Then why do you have a suitcase?

94
00:04:20,140 --> 00:04:22,140
Will you help us in carrying?

95
00:04:22,140 --> 00:04:24,140
With pleasure.

96
00:04:27,140 --> 00:04:29,140
Thank you, Moomin troll.

97
00:04:29,140 --> 00:04:32,140
Think nothing of it. This is a small favor.

98
00:04:32,140 --> 00:04:34,140
We will continue this secret place.

99
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:36,140
The bag is not heavy.

100
00:04:38,140 --> 00:04:40,140
Oh, sorry.

101
00:04:40,140 --> 00:04:44,140
The secret place isn't very secret if I've seen it.

102
00:04:44,140 --> 00:04:46,140
I'm leaving.

103
00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:48,140
Don't snitch on anyone.

104
00:04:48,140 --> 00:04:50,140
Of course not.

105
00:05:00,140 --> 00:05:04,140
What are you doing up there?

106
00:05:04,140 --> 00:05:07,140
What does it look like? I'm coming down.

107
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:12,140
You can't. You're too small.

108
00:05:12,140 --> 00:05:14,140
I pretend I'm not.

109
00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:18,140
Moomin goblin, I would like to ask you one thing.

110
00:05:18,140 --> 00:05:20,140
Ask away.

111
00:05:20,140 --> 00:05:24,140
Didn't Moomin-mama give you a hand too?

112
00:05:24,140 --> 00:05:26,140
Anto, above.

113
00:05:26,140 --> 00:05:30,140
Then you can't have it because morkö took it.

114
00:05:30,140 --> 00:05:32,140
I still have it.

115
00:05:32,140 --> 00:05:34,140
But I don't have any.

116
00:05:34,140 --> 00:05:36,140
I still have.

117
00:05:36,140 --> 00:05:38,140
I still have.

118
00:05:38,140 --> 00:05:40,140
I still have.

119
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:42,140
I still have.

120
00:05:43,140 --> 00:05:46,140
But that's not possible.

121
00:05:46,140 --> 00:05:49,140
We gave Mörö a boot as well.

122
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:51,140
He pretends he didn't.

123
00:05:51,140 --> 00:05:56,140
Well, no, but because of Ed, I say that it was a different shoe.

124
00:05:56,140 --> 00:05:59,140
Ruttika, tell me the truth.

125
00:05:59,140 --> 00:06:01,140
It's a secret.

126
00:06:01,140 --> 00:06:03,140
I want to know.

127
00:06:03,140 --> 00:06:08,140
If you tell, I'll tell you my own secret.

128
00:06:08,140 --> 00:06:09,140
What is it?

129
00:06:09,140 --> 00:06:11,140
The secret of how to sell.

130
00:06:11,140 --> 00:06:13,140
Yes, but what is it?

131
00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:15,140
You tell me first.

132
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:17,140
No, you tell me first.

133
00:06:17,140 --> 00:06:19,140
Let's start telling at once.

134
00:06:19,140 --> 00:06:21,140
Alright, let's do that.

135
00:06:22,140 --> 00:06:24,140
Y, K, K.

136
00:06:24,140 --> 00:06:31,140
Yesterday I went to the swimming pool with Myppeli and we found that female-shaped bow image again and...

137
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:33,140
What? That wooden woman.

138
00:06:33,140 --> 00:06:35,140
The mouth of the cave.

139
00:06:36,140 --> 00:06:39,140
Hey, you haven't shared your secret yet.

140
00:06:39,140 --> 00:06:41,140
Later.

141
00:06:41,140 --> 00:06:43,140
This shit. Tell me first.

142
00:06:43,140 --> 00:06:45,140
Your meat!

143
00:07:06,140 --> 00:07:09,140
What's Moomin doing there?

144
00:07:09,140 --> 00:07:12,140
Are you looking for shoes again?

145
00:07:13,140 --> 00:07:18,140
Maybe he doesn't see shoes, but he's still looking for something.

146
00:07:18,140 --> 00:07:21,140
I think he's important, he's gone.

147
00:07:25,140 --> 00:07:27,140
How far do we have to go?

148
00:07:27,140 --> 00:07:30,140
As long as you row.

149
00:07:30,140 --> 00:07:32,140
The beach is already far away.

150
00:07:32,140 --> 00:07:36,140
This granny will be taken so far that she will never come back.

151
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:40,140
Yes, this is far enough.

152
00:07:40,140 --> 00:07:43,140
There are ocean currents here.

153
00:07:43,140 --> 00:07:46,140
It's further away.

154
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:55,140
He looks sad.

155
00:07:55,140 --> 00:07:57,140
Let's make him happy.

156
00:07:57,140 --> 00:07:59,140
How? There's only one way.

157
00:07:59,140 --> 00:08:01,140
You are right.

158
00:08:11,140 --> 00:08:13,140
Tight and tight.

159
00:08:13,140 --> 00:08:18,140
You look so terribly sad that we thought we'd cheer you up with something either...

160
00:08:20,140 --> 00:08:22,140
That's fine.

161
00:08:22,140 --> 00:08:26,140
It's fine, but you don't have to.

162
00:08:27,140 --> 00:08:32,140
Well, we'll show you what's actually in the suitcase.

163
00:08:32,140 --> 00:08:36,140
Do you want to see? It is very beautiful.

164
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:39,140
Of course I will. Whew!

165
00:08:40,140 --> 00:08:42,140
Hmm.

166
00:08:47,140 --> 00:08:50,140
Do you need help?

167
00:08:50,140 --> 00:08:53,140
No, yes we dye.

168
00:08:57,140 --> 00:09:00,140
Thanks for the help.

169
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:02,140
Now we open the bag.

170
00:09:02,140 --> 00:09:04,140
We're opening up to the first one.

171
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:08,140
Oh, through me.

172
00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:12,140
How do you like it?

173
00:09:12,140 --> 00:09:14,140
That I like?

174
00:09:14,140 --> 00:09:16,140
You're not sad anymore, are you?

175
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:18,140
In.

176
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:20,140
It's fun.

177
00:09:20,140 --> 00:09:22,140
Very funny.

178
00:09:23,140 --> 00:09:27,140
What a ruby, how it changes color.

179
00:09:27,140 --> 00:09:32,140
From warm red to Sapphire blue, then light red.

180
00:09:32,140 --> 00:09:38,140
Just like a flame that flares up and then suddenly it takes on the tinge of a black tulip.

181
00:09:38,140 --> 00:09:42,140
Hmm. Maybe it's the king ruby.

182
00:09:42,140 --> 00:09:44,140
Well, it sure is.

183
00:09:44,140 --> 00:09:46,140
The one the Magician is looking for on the Panther's back.

184
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:48,140
Hi, hi.

185
00:09:48,140 --> 00:09:56,140
He may now be somewhere far, far away looking for a ruby, but he will return to Moomin Valley one day.

186
00:09:56,140 --> 00:10:02,140
First the morkö and now Taikuri, the little polo.

187
00:10:03,140 --> 00:10:12,140
Not even a week had passed when a terrible accident befell Moominvalley as if from a clear sky.

188
00:10:14,140 --> 00:10:16,140
Hmm.

189
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:19,140
Not even in the bedroom.

190
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:22,140
Weird. Where did you see it last?

191
00:10:22,140 --> 00:10:24,140
Somewhere here.

192
00:10:24,140 --> 00:10:28,140
Maybe it's in the garden.

193
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:31,140
I haven't been out all day.

194
00:10:31,140 --> 00:10:35,140
So yes. Moomin mamma's handbag was missing.

195
00:10:35,140 --> 00:10:42,140
The bag contained dry socks, iron wire and aspirin, and a pocket knife for slicing the scumbags.

196
00:10:42,140 --> 00:10:43,140
What is it?

197
00:10:43,140 --> 00:10:48,140
My handbag is missing and I feel so helpless.

198
00:10:48,140 --> 00:10:51,140
Can I get a falcon if I find it?

199
00:10:51,140 --> 00:10:56,140
You can. I will organize a big party for everyone with cakes for everything.

200
00:10:56,140 --> 00:11:00,140
And no one has to wash up in the evening or go to bed early.

201
00:11:00,140 --> 00:11:01,140
I'll find the bags!

202
00:11:01,140 --> 00:11:04,140
Not me.

203
00:11:09,140 --> 00:11:13,140
At least your handbag isn't in the basement.

204
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:16,140
Great, Niiskukulta.

205
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:20,140
However, I haven't been to the basement in days.

206
00:11:29,140 --> 00:11:34,140
Word spread and eventually everyone in Moomin Valley was looking for the handbag.

207
00:11:38,140 --> 00:11:40,140
Is it crowded?

208
00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:43,140
What exactly are they looking for?

209
00:11:47,140 --> 00:11:49,140
My handbag.

210
00:11:49,140 --> 00:11:52,140
The one where you have your little pockets?

211
00:11:52,140 --> 00:11:54,140
Exactly that.

212
00:11:54,140 --> 00:11:57,140
You guys just go play.

213
00:11:59,140 --> 00:12:04,140
It's so nice to sleep in Moomin's handbag.

214
00:12:06,140 --> 00:12:08,140
Mamma seems sad.

215
00:12:08,140 --> 00:12:11,140
Maybe we don't have this.

216
00:12:12,140 --> 00:12:14,140
Mamma seems sad.

217
00:12:14,140 --> 00:12:17,140
Maybe we need to give it back.

218
00:12:31,140 --> 00:12:33,140
Ai.

219
00:12:34,140 --> 00:12:36,140
You found it.

220
00:12:36,140 --> 00:12:38,140
The bag was found.

221
00:12:39,140 --> 00:12:43,140
Tiuhti and faniuhti found Moominmamma's handbag.

222
00:12:48,140 --> 00:12:50,140
Oh, thank you very much.

223
00:12:50,140 --> 00:12:52,140
Where did you find it?

224
00:12:52,140 --> 00:12:55,140
From that little guy. From the big birch.

225
00:12:55,140 --> 00:12:57,140
Moomin's handbag is pretty.

226
00:12:57,140 --> 00:13:02,140
In honor of finding the bag, we're having a big party tonight.

227
00:13:03,140 --> 00:13:11,140
As you know, this party is organized because Moomin's handbag was found.

228
00:13:11,140 --> 00:13:15,140
A big thank you to everyone who participated.

229
00:13:15,140 --> 00:13:19,140
Let's raise a toast to our heroes for tiud and viuhith.

230
00:13:19,140 --> 00:13:24,140
Without a handbag, Moomin Valley would be missing something.

231
00:13:24,140 --> 00:13:26,140
Chip!

232
00:13:33,140 --> 00:13:37,140
Moomin has something to say to you.

233
00:13:37,140 --> 00:13:44,140
We are happy that mom's handbag was found and thank you.

234
00:13:44,140 --> 00:13:47,140
To thank everyone for a great party,

235
00:13:47,140 --> 00:13:53,140
Tiuhti and viuhti have decided to show what is in their mysterious suitcase.

236
00:13:55,140 --> 00:13:58,140
We have a unique opportunity.

237
00:13:58,140 --> 00:14:02,140
Come on, Tiuhti and viuhti, are you ready?

238
00:14:05,140 --> 00:14:06,140
At the ready!

239
00:14:06,140 --> 00:14:08,140
At the ready! Y-ka-ko!

240
00:14:11,140 --> 00:14:13,140
How wonderful!

241
00:14:13,140 --> 00:14:18,140
How could Mörkö exchange a jewel for a shoe?

242
00:14:20,140 --> 00:14:24,140
It must be a royal ruby.

243
00:14:28,140 --> 00:14:31,140
King ruby.

244
00:14:32,140 --> 00:14:34,140
Magician!

245
00:14:39,140 --> 00:14:42,140
The ruby I've sworn to find.

246
00:14:43,140 --> 00:14:46,140
Storm off! The ruby is ours!

247
00:14:46,140 --> 00:14:48,140
Go away evil, Magician!

248
00:14:48,140 --> 00:14:50,140
Magician!

249
00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:52,140
Magician!

250
00:14:52,140 --> 00:14:54,140
Magician!

251
00:14:54,140 --> 00:14:56,140
Magician!

252
00:14:56,140 --> 00:14:58,140
Go away evil, Magician!

253
00:14:58,140 --> 00:15:01,140
The ruby is my property.

254
00:15:01,140 --> 00:15:03,140
And it's not!

255
00:15:03,140 --> 00:15:08,140
Mörkö changed it with Tiuhti ja viuhit for a heart-shaped shoe.

256
00:15:08,140 --> 00:15:10,140
Or even a heart-shaped shoe?

257
00:15:10,140 --> 00:15:12,140
That's right!

258
00:15:14,140 --> 00:15:18,140
Mörkö gave the ruby to these two and I saw it with my own eyes.

259
00:15:18,140 --> 00:15:23,140
I have been searching for this ruby for 300 years.

260
00:15:24,140 --> 00:15:27,140
Sad, but it's not yours.

261
00:15:27,140 --> 00:15:33,140
Couldn't you exchange the ruby for, say, two large diamonds?

262
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:35,140
No way!

263
00:15:43,140 --> 00:15:47,140
I can't take the ruby by force.

264
00:15:47,140 --> 00:15:51,140
This is getting on my nerves.

265
00:15:53,140 --> 00:15:55,140
Magician!

266
00:16:01,140 --> 00:16:06,140
Would the Magician like a mug of punch?

267
00:16:06,140 --> 00:16:12,140
Thanks, I haven't had a punch in 85 years.

268
00:16:12,140 --> 00:16:14,140
Quince.

269
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:16,140
It's you too.

270
00:16:16,140 --> 00:16:18,140
Could there be more?

271
00:16:18,140 --> 00:16:20,140
Thanks, that's enough.

272
00:16:20,140 --> 00:16:25,140
Magicians are not potions.

273
00:16:25,140 --> 00:16:28,140
Great, Christmas, right, punch.

274
00:16:28,140 --> 00:16:31,140
Or it's up to you now.

275
00:16:31,140 --> 00:16:33,140
I'll show you some magic.

276
00:16:33,140 --> 00:16:35,140
You can hope three times.

277
00:16:35,140 --> 00:16:37,140
Do you have anything?

278
00:16:37,140 --> 00:16:39,140
I'll show you some magic.

279
00:16:39,140 --> 00:16:41,140
You can hope three times.

280
00:16:41,140 --> 00:16:43,140
Please and hope.

281
00:16:43,140 --> 00:16:46,140
Three of you in line to wish.

282
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:50,140
What now, are you afraid?

283
00:16:50,140 --> 00:16:52,140
You look so old, you're not afraid.

284
00:16:52,140 --> 00:16:54,140
I'm not afraid.

285
00:16:54,140 --> 00:16:58,140
Oh yes, broke the Spade I had borrowed from Moomipapa.

286
00:16:58,140 --> 00:17:00,140
I hope Spade.

287
00:17:00,140 --> 00:17:03,140
No such wishes.

288
00:17:03,140 --> 00:17:06,140
I would like a new Shovel.

289
00:17:06,140 --> 00:17:08,140
Keep what you get.

290
00:17:10,140 --> 00:17:14,140
Oh, thank you very much.

291
00:17:14,140 --> 00:17:16,140
Thanks for the loan.

292
00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:18,140
Next.

293
00:17:18,140 --> 00:17:20,140
Sorry, but...

294
00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:25,140
What can I do for you, young lady?

295
00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:27,140
It can be a bit difficult.

296
00:17:27,140 --> 00:17:29,140
For me?

297
00:17:30,140 --> 00:17:33,140
Is that what you want?

298
00:17:33,140 --> 00:17:34,140
So.

299
00:17:34,140 --> 00:17:36,140
Come your eyes.

300
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:41,140
Your wish has come true, little lady.

301
00:17:44,140 --> 00:17:46,140
Oh my goodness.

302
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:48,140
Low no go.

303
00:17:48,140 --> 00:17:54,140
I wished for similar eyes when I am with that legless woman who is so beautiful to you.

304
00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:56,140
You changed completely.

305
00:17:56,140 --> 00:17:58,140
Please give me a mirror.

306
00:17:58,140 --> 00:18:01,140
Quite beautiful actually.

307
00:18:05,140 --> 00:18:07,140
Kamala!

308
00:18:11,140 --> 00:18:14,140
Would I get my old eyes back?

309
00:18:14,140 --> 00:18:17,140
I only complain about one wishful thinking.

310
00:18:23,140 --> 00:18:26,140
Mr. Magician, may I have hope now?

311
00:18:26,140 --> 00:18:31,140
Please, golden carriage, crystal goblet, whatever.

312
00:18:31,140 --> 00:18:36,140
At least I would like a sack full of gold coins.

313
00:18:36,140 --> 00:18:38,140
Moomin wishes.

314
00:18:38,140 --> 00:18:44,140
You hear, keep two sacks, and I'll get another one. What do you say about that?

315
00:18:44,140 --> 00:18:47,140
I've already made my decision.

316
00:18:47,140 --> 00:18:48,140
Ai.

317
00:18:48,140 --> 00:18:52,140
Please, restore the eyes of the little girl.

318
00:18:52,140 --> 00:18:55,140
He can see well in those too.

319
00:18:55,140 --> 00:18:57,140
Goodbye gold coins.

320
00:18:57,140 --> 00:19:02,140
The wish has been heard and fulfilled.

321
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:09,140
Well look, you would have thought before you wished.

322
00:19:09,140 --> 00:19:11,140
My Moomin.

323
00:19:14,140 --> 00:19:16,140
Magician.

324
00:19:16,140 --> 00:19:17,140
What?

325
00:19:17,140 --> 00:19:22,140
If you can do magic like that, why not do it for yourself?

326
00:19:22,140 --> 00:19:26,140
It doesn't work like magic only on others.

327
00:19:26,140 --> 00:19:30,140
So is it okay for us to wish something for you together?

328
00:19:30,140 --> 00:19:32,140
Yes, I guess.

329
00:19:32,140 --> 00:19:34,140
Give us hope.

330
00:19:34,140 --> 00:19:37,140
In for a penny in for a pound.

331
00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:40,140
We wish you a similar ruby.

332
00:19:40,140 --> 00:19:42,140
Keep what you get.

333
00:19:48,140 --> 00:19:50,140
It's for you.

334
00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:55,140
Thank you, thank you.

335
00:19:56,140 --> 00:19:58,140
Thanks.

336
00:20:02,140 --> 00:20:06,140
That's how the magician's 300-year search ended.

337
00:20:06,140 --> 00:20:10,140
And Moomin Valley has never celebrated so joyfully.

338
00:20:10,140 --> 00:20:12,140
Everyone was happy.

339
00:20:12,140 --> 00:20:17,140
Except maybe a nitwit who would have liked a bag of gold coins.

340
00:20:26,140 --> 00:20:28,140
Thank you, thank you.
