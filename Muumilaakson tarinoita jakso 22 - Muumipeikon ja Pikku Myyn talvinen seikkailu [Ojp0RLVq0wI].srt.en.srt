1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Moomin is fast asleep. So are Moominpa and Moominma.

2
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Moomins are so sensible that they always sleep all winter.

3
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Their ancestors centuries ago did the same and the Moomins are tradition lovers.

4
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:44,000
However, something unprecedented is happening now. Moomin wakes up and never sleeps again.

5
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
What time is it?

6
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:14,000
17 more than two evenings during the day, I think. Although it doesn't matter when you hibernate.

7
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
The clock has stopped.

8
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Cold and dark.

9
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Mom, mom please get up.

10
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Father, father.

11
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Mom, mom, I woke up suddenly and I can't sleep.

12
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:59,000
It's strange, you shouldn't wake up from hibernation.

13
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:19,900
Dim, dim, Corona stopped talking, 张國式力力

14
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:23,260
J

15
00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:33,260
Oh, snow, the Moomin House is buried in the cinemas.

16
00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:30,260
This is not Moomin Valley.

17
00:03:33,260 --> 00:03:35,260
Mouse quiet.

18
00:03:42,260 --> 00:03:44,260
What is it?

19
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:47,260
Maybe I should go back home.

20
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:53,260
No, it's even worse at home when everyone is asleep and the furniture is dusty.

21
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:13,260
If only snuff Muikkunen were here, but he's far in the south.

22
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:19,260
Sound.

23
00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:39,260
What the hell is that sound?

24
00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:49,260
What the hell is that sound?

25
00:05:17,260 --> 00:05:20,260
Then you plunged like a whirlwind towards me.

26
00:05:20,260 --> 00:05:22,260
Yes, I know that, Tollo.

27
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:27,260
But what do you do for a living? Why don't you hibernate like everyone else?

28
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:30,260
I don't know. I just woke up.

29
00:05:30,260 --> 00:05:35,260
Why are you going down the slide? You yourself should be sleeping.

30
00:05:35,260 --> 00:05:39,260
I also woke up at times, apparently so that I could shepherd you.

31
00:05:39,260 --> 00:05:44,260
I tried to wake up my sister too, but she just snored. I like snow.

32
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:51,260
I don't. It's cold and slippery and too white and quiet and there's snow everywhere.

33
00:05:51,260 --> 00:05:53,260
I saw the grunt.

34
00:05:53,260 --> 00:05:56,260
Oh that creepy creepy monster.

35
00:05:56,260 --> 00:06:00,260
Mörö should feel at home in this weather.

36
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:02,260
By the way, Mörkö was on the mountain.

37
00:06:02,260 --> 00:06:04,260
Then I heard a grumpy voice.

38
00:06:04,260 --> 00:06:09,260
Frame! Mörkö is so freezing cold that I didn't even want to bite into it.

39
00:06:09,260 --> 00:06:12,260
There's a puddle over there.

40
00:06:15,260 --> 00:06:18,260
I got chills.

41
00:06:18,260 --> 00:06:20,260
It's natural in a snowstorm.

42
00:06:20,260 --> 00:06:23,260
The grub gave me chills.

43
00:06:23,260 --> 00:06:29,260
Look at my skin. It looks different than in summer. Doesn't it look like it?

44
00:06:29,260 --> 00:06:32,260
But my cold is not caused by the snow, but by the sleet.

45
00:06:32,260 --> 00:06:34,260
I'm afraid too.

46
00:06:45,260 --> 00:06:47,260
It tasted good.

47
00:06:47,260 --> 00:06:49,260
I'll drink as much as you want.

48
00:06:49,260 --> 00:06:54,260
Last summer, my mother and I collected more baboons than ever before.

49
00:06:54,260 --> 00:06:56,260
Thanks.

50
00:06:57,260 --> 00:07:00,260
Help me get that down.

51
00:07:01,260 --> 00:07:03,260
A silver tray?

52
00:07:03,260 --> 00:07:04,260
So.

53
00:07:04,260 --> 00:07:05,260
For what the hell?

54
00:07:05,260 --> 00:07:08,260
That I can count even a hill in that game.

55
00:07:08,260 --> 00:07:10,260
The tray is our family treasure.

56
00:07:11,260 --> 00:07:13,260
Which you never use.

57
00:07:13,260 --> 00:07:18,260
A polished tray is much better for rioting than Hutera's cardboard box.

58
00:07:23,260 --> 00:07:26,260
They sleep like April honey.

59
00:07:26,260 --> 00:07:31,260
I still think it was terribly unfair that I woke up.

60
00:07:34,260 --> 00:07:36,260
What do we do now?

61
00:07:36,260 --> 00:07:38,260
I'm going to see the sea.

62
00:07:38,260 --> 00:07:41,260
Do not! At least there is no snow on the sea.

63
00:07:54,260 --> 00:07:57,260
Isn't it okay to leave it to the lady?

64
00:08:00,260 --> 00:08:01,260
Jumpers

65
00:08:01,260 --> 00:08:03,260
What's wrong now?

66
00:08:03,260 --> 00:08:05,260
I forgot the tray.

67
00:08:05,260 --> 00:08:08,260
What do you need it for now? There's no point in it.

68
00:08:08,260 --> 00:08:09,260
Oh yes it is.

69
00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:10,260
What do you mean?

70
00:08:10,260 --> 00:08:12,260
Now you can see the sea.

71
00:08:19,260 --> 00:08:20,260
My beautiful Sea is frozen.

72
00:08:20,260 --> 00:08:22,260
You can glide over the sea.

73
00:08:24,260 --> 00:08:25,260
What is that?

74
00:08:35,260 --> 00:08:36,260
I feel it.

75
00:08:56,260 --> 00:08:57,260
Tuttik!

76
00:08:57,260 --> 00:08:59,260
What! How are you?

77
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:03,260
Aren't you hibernating too?

78
00:09:03,260 --> 00:09:06,260
Before. I haven't had time to sleep in months.

79
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:10,260
Little mye and I just woke up. And we couldn't think of anything to do.

80
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:12,260
Use your imagination.

81
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:13,260
Let's try.

82
00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:16,260
I have never seen an ice-free sea before.

83
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:18,260
Have you made a horse?

84
00:09:18,260 --> 00:09:19,260
I am.

85
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:20,260
Can I ride a horse?

86
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:24,260
You can't. I have molded a horse for the ice lady.

87
00:09:24,260 --> 00:09:25,260
Oh for the sake?

88
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:27,260
I guess you've heard of the ice lady?

89
00:09:27,260 --> 00:09:32,260
It's me. She is very beautiful, but whoever looks into her eyes turns to ice.

90
00:09:32,260 --> 00:09:34,260
Mrs. Ice is a badass.

91
00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:38,260
It is. And spring won't dare to come as long as the ice lady is here.

92
00:09:38,260 --> 00:09:42,260
Will that ice lady ride this horse on her way?

93
00:09:42,260 --> 00:09:44,260
At least I hope so.

94
00:09:44,260 --> 00:09:46,260
He squares north.

95
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:50,260
And then he doesn't come back until the following winter.

96
00:09:50,260 --> 00:09:52,260
The horse doesn't look very sturdy.

97
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:56,260
So. That's why I lied with the horse's water.

98
00:09:56,260 --> 00:09:59,260
The frost makes it rock hard.

99
00:09:59,260 --> 00:10:01,260
Well, when will the ice lady come?

100
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:04,260
I don't know. Tonight maybe.

101
00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:07,260
The weather seems to be getting colder.

102
00:10:20,260 --> 00:10:23,260
Tuutikki, what has happened to the sun?

103
00:10:23,260 --> 00:10:25,260
When will it appear?

104
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:28,260
The sun is now in the south and warms up the snuff from the muikku.

105
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:33,260
But soon it will come back and will be visible a little longer every day.

106
00:10:33,260 --> 00:10:34,260
Good.

107
00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:38,260
But tonight is the full moon. Admire its glow.

108
00:10:38,260 --> 00:10:42,260
Humdinger. Then I see get the tray.

109
00:10:42,260 --> 00:10:43,260
Which tray?

110
00:10:43,260 --> 00:10:45,260
Moomin mamma on a silver tray.

111
00:10:45,260 --> 00:10:49,260
Attach a sail to it and then sail with it on the ice.

112
00:10:49,260 --> 00:10:50,260
Leave it for tomorrow.

113
00:10:50,260 --> 00:10:53,260
I don't leave anything for tomorrow that I can do today.

114
00:10:53,260 --> 00:10:56,260
Ice can suddenly melt.

115
00:10:58,260 --> 00:11:01,260
I like this apartment.

116
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:04,260
Especially from colored window panes.

117
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:06,260
Papa has built a bathroom.

118
00:11:06,260 --> 00:11:10,260
He will be happy to hear that you live here.

119
00:11:10,260 --> 00:11:12,260
Our papa is so clever.

120
00:11:12,260 --> 00:11:16,260
He creates a swimming room that is suitable even for winter use.

121
00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:18,260
Mother will probably say.

122
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:31,260
Aren't you hibernating too?

123
00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:32,260
Doesn't fade away.

124
00:11:32,260 --> 00:11:34,260
Creepy ice grass is coming.

125
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:38,260
If he looks at you, the eyes will go away.

126
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:03,260
Moomin week! Tuttik! Listen!

127
00:12:05,260 --> 00:12:08,260
Hit it! Muumiveikko!

128
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:10,260
Sell! We are here!

129
00:12:12,260 --> 00:12:14,260
What the hell are you doing there?

130
00:12:14,260 --> 00:12:17,260
Tuutikki is here fishing.

131
00:12:17,260 --> 00:12:20,260
He is going to cook us dinner.

132
00:12:20,260 --> 00:12:23,260
Then I'll start the ice pick immediately.

133
00:12:23,260 --> 00:12:26,260
I'm going to see what Myy is doing to mom's tray.

134
00:12:26,260 --> 00:12:27,260
Just go.

135
00:12:30,260 --> 00:12:32,260
Uh, the fish eats.

136
00:12:37,260 --> 00:12:39,260
Uh, ran away.

137
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:44,260
Oh boys, it's cold under the ice.

138
00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:46,260
How is it going little Myy?

139
00:12:46,260 --> 00:12:48,260
Yes, this is going to be a dick.

140
00:12:50,260 --> 00:12:52,260
Why is it possible to be under the ice?

141
00:12:52,260 --> 00:12:54,260
Why is it possible to be under the ice?

142
00:12:54,260 --> 00:12:57,260
I guess that's because the water is low.

143
00:12:57,260 --> 00:12:58,260
Why does ice sink?

144
00:12:58,260 --> 00:13:02,260
The ice does not sink because it is attached to the shores.

145
00:13:02,260 --> 00:13:04,260
I would guess so.

146
00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:06,260
Well, there is an explanation.

147
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:11,260
Tuutikki eats fish soup every single day.

148
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:17,260
I'm going to see if the horse is frozen.

149
00:13:18,260 --> 00:13:20,260
Don't miss the tail Ove.

150
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:25,260
I don't think it's strong enough.

151
00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:29,260
The horse will surely break if the ice screw tries to ride.

152
00:13:32,260 --> 00:13:35,260
It suddenly got freezing cold.

153
00:13:52,260 --> 00:13:54,260
Bogey.

154
00:13:58,260 --> 00:14:01,260
Don't just say you want to ride.

155
00:14:03,260 --> 00:14:05,260
You better not try.

156
00:14:05,260 --> 00:14:08,260
The horse is meant for the ice lady.

157
00:14:10,260 --> 00:14:13,260
The horse is meant for the ice lady.

158
00:14:14,260 --> 00:14:17,260
The horse is meant for the ice lady.

159
00:14:17,260 --> 00:14:20,260
The horse is meant for the ice lady.

160
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:26,260
No one can say what the ice lady does, but she probably looks into the eyes.

161
00:14:38,260 --> 00:14:41,260
The ice lady seems to be too much for the grunt.

162
00:14:42,260 --> 00:14:45,260
The horse has turned into ice.

163
00:14:45,260 --> 00:14:47,260
The horse has turned into ice.

164
00:15:03,260 --> 00:15:05,260
Wasn't it wonderful?

165
00:15:05,260 --> 00:15:07,260
It was. The old tray is absolutely useless.

166
00:15:07,260 --> 00:15:09,260
Will you give it a try?

167
00:15:09,260 --> 00:15:10,260
I'm too heavy.

168
00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:14,260
Coming in already. Fish soup is ready. It doesn't taste cold.

169
00:15:14,260 --> 00:15:16,260
Hot fish soup. I'm leaving again.

170
00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:17,260
Don't you?

171
00:15:17,260 --> 00:15:18,260
And why?

172
00:15:19,260 --> 00:15:22,260
Don't you remember? I told him that the ice lady can come.

173
00:15:23,260 --> 00:15:24,260
It happens.

174
00:15:24,260 --> 00:15:27,260
But I want to see him. I'm not scared at all.

175
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:29,260
I can be careful-

176
00:15:29,260 --> 00:15:31,260
Sell. What if he looks you in the eye?

177
00:15:31,260 --> 00:15:34,260
I won't let him meet my gaze.

178
00:15:34,260 --> 00:15:38,260
What if he is fast? And you don't have time to dodge?

179
00:15:38,260 --> 00:15:42,260
Let's watch the ice lady from the bathroom window so she doesn't see us.

180
00:15:45,260 --> 00:15:51,260
Oh, oh. Quick back in, Myyy. There it is now.

181
00:15:55,260 --> 00:15:57,260
I want to see the ice lady!

182
00:15:57,260 --> 00:15:58,260
Sell!

183
00:15:58,260 --> 00:15:59,260
You can't go!

184
00:16:04,260 --> 00:16:05,260
Sell!

185
00:16:06,260 --> 00:16:07,260
Come back!

186
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:11,260
What now?

187
00:16:11,260 --> 00:16:14,260
Well, let's even stay safe inside.

188
00:16:30,260 --> 00:16:31,260
Ice lady!

189
00:16:41,260 --> 00:16:44,260
Oh, oh, oh.

190
00:16:59,260 --> 00:17:01,260
I saw you grow up ice lady!

191
00:17:02,260 --> 00:17:04,260
I saw, I saw, I saw!

192
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:09,260
I hope Myyy will survive.

193
00:17:09,260 --> 00:17:14,260
Yes, Myyy always does tricks like that. He is absolutely like that.

194
00:17:14,260 --> 00:17:18,260
I hope Myyle doesn't go though. You should just keep your mouth shut.

195
00:17:39,260 --> 00:17:41,260
Oh, oh, oh.

196
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:43,260
Oh, oh, oh.

197
00:18:06,260 --> 00:18:09,260
Myyy, myyy, I saw you grow up, ice lady!

198
00:18:09,260 --> 00:18:11,260
Oh, oh, oh.

199
00:18:27,260 --> 00:18:30,260
Blow wind, blow!

200
00:18:31,260 --> 00:18:33,260
I'm in trouble!

201
00:18:36,260 --> 00:18:37,260
Sell!

202
00:18:39,260 --> 00:18:41,260
Oh, oh, oh.

203
00:19:09,260 --> 00:19:12,260
Oh, oh, oh.

204
00:19:24,260 --> 00:19:25,260
Sell!

205
00:19:33,260 --> 00:19:35,260
Please little Myyy, wake up!

206
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:38,260
Sell!

207
00:19:39,260 --> 00:19:41,260
Myyy, honey, wake up!

208
00:19:41,260 --> 00:19:45,260
Don't worry Myyy, we'll melt you down in no time.

209
00:20:00,260 --> 00:20:02,260
Oh, you're taking my leg!

210
00:20:02,260 --> 00:20:05,260
Myyy, you're done again!

211
00:20:05,260 --> 00:20:07,260
So Myyy really was.

212
00:20:08,260 --> 00:20:12,260
Little Myyy will not disappear from this world.
