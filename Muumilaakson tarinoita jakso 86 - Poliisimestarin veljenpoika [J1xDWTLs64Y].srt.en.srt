00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,760
Nourin

2
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:10,720
Yii, dude, dude, dude!

3
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:13,440
Indian Tofo. Indian brawl.

4
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:15,520
Get over here!

5
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:22,480
GDP�� is all diel lol

6
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:26,600
lvpoints

7
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:28,400
I love it so much

8
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:30,400
Who's here?

9
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:38,400
Someone shot my arrow helmet.

10
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:41,400
Who the hell was that?

11
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:43,400
Sorry.

12
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:46,400
Oh, it was you. I will arrest you.

13
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:49,400
Phooey.

14
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:50,400
Ai.

15
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:52,400
It was an attempted murder.

16
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:54,400
Sorry.

17
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:56,400
It was an attempted murder.

18
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:58,400
Sorry.

19
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:00,400
It was just a hiccup.

20
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:02,400
Don't underestimate the police.

21
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:08,400
What's going on here?

22
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:10,400
Oops. Was that some new policeman?

23
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:12,400
Let's go see.

24
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:14,400
Joo.

25
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:20,400
Ai.

26
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:22,400
Let me out of the cell.

27
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:24,400
Moomin-Pekko has done nothing wrong.

28
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:26,400
Not so.

29
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:28,400
What are you wearing?

30
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:30,400
Smuggled goods?

31
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:32,400
This is just a game.

32
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:34,400
Secondly.

33
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:38,400
You are accused of attempted murder against police officers.

34
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:40,400
Well, it was a toy, stupid.

35
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,400
Well, let it be just a toy.

36
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:44,400
What did you change?

37
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:46,400
Oh, I was about to faint.

38
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:50,400
I was warmer because I am a Toori laifikko.

39
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:52,400
What have you done guys?

40
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:54,400
Let's keep you all.

41
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:56,400
Launo, what happened?

42
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:58,400
Dear Police Chief, please help us.

43
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:00,400
Moomin-Pekko is accused of attempted murder.

44
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:02,400
Kind police chief.

45
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:04,400
The new constable must be fired.

46
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:06,400
Police Chief.

47
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:08,400
Moomin-Pekko, what's the matter?

48
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:12,400
And my first criminal.

49
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,400
Or a criminal?

50
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,400
I'm so sorry, Moomin.

51
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:20,400
Thank you, Chief Constable.

52
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:22,400
I've never seen that guy before.

53
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:26,400
He is my nephew Launo.

54
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:30,400
He's not a cop.

55
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,400
Don't smell it.

56
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:34,400
Come on then.

57
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:36,400
You will see it again.

58
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,400
I am a police career.

59
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,400
You can calm down, Launo.

60
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,400
My nephew is still in the early stages of his career.

61
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,400
Very timid.

62
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,400
I understand, he is a yellow beak.

63
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,400
I'll show you the yellow nut.

64
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:50,400
Wet-eared Yellowbill.

65
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,400
The policeman was cheated by the kid.

66
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,400
Instead of roasting, it's just rock.

67
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:56,400
Left on the table.

68
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:00,400
We still have a show for you.

69
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:02,400
That's what I'd like to show.

70
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,400
I'll show you I'll show you I'll show you

71
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:06,400
The Konsta game calms down now.

72
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:08,400
Sell is just a ball.

73
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,400
But that...

74
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:12,400
Don't call me that.

75
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,400
You call me police chief.

76
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,400
You call me police chief.

77
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:18,400
Police Chief.

78
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:32,400
Host.

79
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,400
This is at the police station.

80
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:38,400
What?

81
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,400
Right.

82
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:42,400
Yes.

83
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:44,400
Huh, huh.

84
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,400
What's the matter, Chief Constable?

85
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:50,400
The police chief inspector is coming here on an inspection trip.

86
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,400
Oh, is it true?

87
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,400
That's my spatial relationship.

88
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,400
Ai.

89
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,400
I make the biggest catch of the year

90
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:02,400
and the chief inspector is usually my accounting officer.

91
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:06,400
I can't say I like that guy.

92
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,400
Too eager.

93
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:10,400
So.

94
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:16,400
Otherwise, it's a disgustingly peaceful place.

95
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:20,400
And big robberies can't happen here either,

96
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:22,400
when there are no banks or jewelers.

97
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:26,400
Is there even any kind of violence here?

98
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:30,400
How do I get promoted?

99
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:34,400
Yes, it's pocket money here!

100
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:38,400
A mysterious unsolved case of death.

101
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:42,400
He kills and doesn't use a knife or a gun.

102
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:46,400
Do you have a horror novel in the works?

103
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:50,400
I thought I'd try how writing a detective story goes.

104
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:54,400
Have an idea for the perfect murder?

105
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:56,400
No rose without a thorn.

106
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,400
Would it have substance?

107
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:02,400
The rose is a pretty ineffective murder weapon.

108
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,400
Murder in the plans.

109
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:08,400
No, no, I meant these.

110
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:14,400
There are beautiful toadstools.

111
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:16,400
Oh, and deadly poisonous.

112
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:18,400
Absolutely.

113
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:20,400
I could hide them in mushroom soup, for example.

114
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:22,400
That's fine.

115
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:26,400
Killing is possible without guns and knives.

116
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:28,400
Oh, horrible!

117
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:30,400
In your fields!

118
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:32,400
Who are you?

119
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:38,400
New constable and I'm arresting you on suspicion of plotting to murder with fly agarics.

120
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:40,400
Share, detention.

121
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:50,400
Moomin, what do you say about our police station?

122
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:52,400
Is that gun on the wall a real weapon?

123
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:54,400
No, it's just a decoration.

124
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:58,400
Let's go sip some tea sometime.

125
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,400
That's fine.

126
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,400
These cookies taste great.

127
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:06,400
Did you bake them yourself?

128
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:08,400
Yeah, it's me.

129
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:10,400
You are good!

130
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:12,400
Cook!

131
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:14,400
Even my mother couldn't have baked better.

132
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:16,400
No one can beat Moomin.

133
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:22,400
What now?

134
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:24,400
That's it, police chief!

135
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:26,400
I arrested two Catalan criminals.

136
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:28,400
Come this way!

137
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:34,400
What?

138
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:36,400
What exactly is the matter?

139
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:38,400
Out of a misconception, I guess.

140
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:42,400
Chief of Police, these two met planning

141
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:44,400
horrible murder.

142
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:46,400
No, but...

143
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:48,400
Not so.

144
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:52,400
Moomin plans to secretly write a police novel.

145
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:54,400
Yeah, I don't want to kill anyone.

146
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:56,400
If you don't want to kill anyone,

147
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58,400
but nevertheless kills.

148
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:00,400
Is quite cold-blooded in nature.

149
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:02,400
Fire up!

150
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:04,400
Listen now, Launo.

151
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:06,400
They are my best friends

152
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:10,400
and much more important to me than my distant fellow citizens.

153
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:12,400
But police master they are!

154
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:14,400
They are not criminals.

155
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,400
We play poker together.

156
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:20,400
It's not worth it.

157
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:22,400
Being a police officer is probably not easy.

158
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:26,400
Hi, a completely understandable misunderstanding.

159
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:28,400
We shouldn't have bottomed.

160
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:30,400
We shouldn't have considered

161
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:32,400
Jenner details out loud.

162
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:34,400
Not so.

163
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:36,400
Pope now, wet ear!

164
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:40,400
Why not go arrest fly agarics, for example?

165
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:46,400
There must be criminals walking around here.

166
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:52,400
The kind of criminals not protected by the local police force.

167
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:54,400
I'm going to deliver the post!

168
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:56,400
I'm going to be an over-the-top player!

169
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:02,400
Launo is incredibly simple.

170
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:06,400
No, you can't.

171
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:08,400
Back to the room right away.

172
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:10,400
The fun is over at this point.

173
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:14,400
Excuse me, good lady.

174
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:18,400
Madam, I understand they are minors.

175
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:20,400
I know that.

176
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,400
And I'm going to deliver the post.

177
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:24,400
I know that.

178
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:26,400
And I do homework on them because they are mine.

179
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:30,400
It seems to be an obvious case of children's bad thinking.

180
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:34,400
What?

181
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:36,400
Let the police come.

182
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:38,400
No, don't.

183
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:40,400
Let go.

184
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:42,400
You misunderstood.

185
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:44,400
Believe me.

186
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:46,400
Yes, ma'am, that's what those criminals always say.

187
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:48,400
No, ma'am!

188
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:50,400
And you don't mean me?

189
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:52,400
What do you do with those books?

190
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:54,400
Good day, Vili-Joukka.

191
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:56,400
Who is this friend of yours?

192
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:58,400
Or my friend?

193
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:00,400
Don't try to mess things up, ma'am.

194
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:06,400
Are the books your property?

195
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:08,400
Well, no.

196
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:12,400
I'm just about to return these books that Moominpappa has borrowed.

197
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:14,400
Bad explanation.

198
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:18,400
Wait, the books fell on the ground.

199
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:22,400
Now!

200
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:26,400
So, so!

201
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:28,400
Do not steal government property.

202
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:30,400
These fallen branches.

203
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:32,400
Arrested!

204
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:34,400
Arrested!

205
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:36,400
That was the least.

206
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:38,400
Arrested! Arrested!

207
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:40,400
Arrested!

208
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:44,400
Explain what this means.

209
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:46,400
Police Chief!

210
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:48,400
I arrested all these law breakers in the act itself.

211
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:50,400
And the campers themselves!

212
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:52,400
Mom is here too.

213
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:53,400
Moomin troll.

214
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:54,400
I can't believe this.

215
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:56,400
Get me out of here now!

216
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:58,400
There's also one.

217
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:00,400
Huh? I smelled in the cell.

218
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:02,400
What theater is this?

219
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:04,400
What is it about?

220
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:08,400
There is no one left in Moomilaakso when everything has been taken away.

221
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:16,400
Launo!

222
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:20,400
Kaya!

223
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:24,400
The Chief Inspector of Police will be here soon.

224
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:27,400
How can you keep Launo away from a bad deed?

225
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:40,400
Launu should arrest real criminals, not mom and dad.

226
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:43,400
They all appear to be that old.

227
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:46,400
Then why are they kept on the wall?

228
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:49,400
That it would look more like a police station here.

229
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:51,400
For a change.

230
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:54,400
Now I invented!

231
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:58,400
Launo! Launo!

232
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:04,400
You have an important mission.

233
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:07,400
I'm sure you can do it.

234
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:09,400
Or rather.

235
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:11,400
You are the only one who can do it.

236
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:12,400
Joo!

237
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:19,400
There have been reports that these thieves who committed the heinous burglaries have been seen in Moomilaakso.

238
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:21,400
Really?

239
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:24,400
They have guns and they are dangerous.

240
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:26,400
Why are you telling me now?

241
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:29,400
Why not as soon as I got here?

242
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:33,400
That's why I haven't been sure that you're up to it.

243
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:35,400
But now I'm sure.

244
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:37,400
I will not disappoint your expectations.

245
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:40,400
They'll be in trouble, I guarantee it.

246
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:47,400
Listen, how confident you are. Launo set off.

247
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:52,400
Chief of Police, are you sure that Launo will catch the burglars?

248
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:56,400
At least I got to get him into other scenery for a while.

249
00:11:58,400 --> 00:11:59,400
What for?

250
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:05,400
You can't be here making arrests when the police chief inspector comes.

251
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:08,400
Yes, Launo could be a lot of trouble.

252
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:10,400
So.

253
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:15,400
First of all, I have to take care of my mainer.

254
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:21,400
One nephew here or there, as long as my long career remains unblemished.

255
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:23,400
That's the main thing.

256
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:24,400
That's true.

257
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:25,400
So.

258
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:27,400
Correctly stated.

259
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:30,400
Good day!

260
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:34,400
What do I look like?

261
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:36,400
Who are you?

262
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:38,400
Secret agent.

263
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:42,400
If I wear a police uniform, criminals will immediately get under my feet.

264
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:46,400
In this outfit, I look like anyone else, or what do you think?

265
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:49,400
We professionals have brains.

266
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:51,400
Professional!

267
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:54,400
I'm leaving now!

268
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:57,400
Have a nice trip!

269
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:59,400
A minute!

270
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:03,400
Real detectives always have an assistant.

271
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:06,400
Moomi!

272
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:11,400
I appoint you as my assistant.

273
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:13,400
A minute?

274
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:17,400
You have been appointed to assist me in solving this important matter.

275
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:20,400
Moomi, Goblin, it could be fun.

276
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:23,400
Uh, sell, don't tease me.

277
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:24,400
Let's go.

278
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:27,400
And no, I didn't come.

279
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:31,400
Good luck in your search!

280
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:34,400
Sherlock Holmes ja Watson!

281
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:36,400
The celebrants!

282
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:38,400
Moomi, Goblin, rascal.

283
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:43,400
Pity Moomi, Goblin, but we can have a moment in peace.

284
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:49,400
Launo, you look here.

285
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:52,400
Salapolisi, Launo, if suitable.

286
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:54,400
Well, what's the matter?

287
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:55,400
Footprints.

288
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:57,400
Is there? You are witty.

289
00:13:57,400 --> 00:14:00,400
What would you say about those?

290
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:04,400
There, there are two of them it seems.

291
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:06,400
Yeah, I know that.

292
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:13,400
They have presumably gone in that direction.

293
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:15,400
Well, it's obvious.

294
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:17,400
That's a long way, Moomi, Goblin!

295
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:19,400
We don't know if they are criminals?

296
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:21,400
They must be found first!

297
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:25,400
Check it out and attach it to my badge chest yourself!

298
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:30,400
The team succeeded.

299
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:32,400
This can be called a catch.

300
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:35,400
Good miracle, real thieves and we found them.

301
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:37,400
Don't get excited.

302
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:39,400
This is not so easy.

303
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:43,400
But they look just like the bandits in the photos.

304
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:45,400
That's how a typical amateur talks.

305
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:49,400
I'd say it's a complete disguise.

306
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:53,400
A thug doesn't dress like that, they're cops.

307
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:54,400
But...

308
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:58,400
They infiltrated criminals and lured them into a trap.

309
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:00,400
Can it be so?

310
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:01,400
You'll see.

311
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:03,400
Well, this became clear.

312
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:05,400
Let's start the next thing.

313
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:08,400
Bye! How, Metku!

314
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:10,400
What the hell, Metku?

315
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:11,400
Who are you?

316
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:14,400
You have also brought a chest for loot.

317
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:17,400
Good cookie and really great, Valeppuku.

318
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:19,400
Dummy hat?

319
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:21,400
Hyss, to be in the elevator.

320
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:23,400
We also belong to male strength.

321
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:24,400
Oh yeah.

322
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:28,400
You see, I'm the laun of a top class detective.

323
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:29,400
Yes?

324
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:32,400
Don't be at all.

325
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:35,400
We don't drive work into your criminal case.

326
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:39,400
As long as justice is served, that is the most important thing.

327
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:41,400
Just that right.

328
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:47,400
I did, so you assume that criminals attack from a boat.

329
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:49,400
What exactly is the matter?

330
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:52,400
They seem to think we are the police.

331
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:55,400
Hey, are you really police officers?

332
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:58,400
Huh? Yeah, we're certain.

333
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:02,400
Hehehe, of course!

334
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:09,400
That Ipana sees right through us.

335
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:12,400
Or maybe this is a weird trap.

336
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:14,400
Believing that we are in disguise,

337
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:18,400
but they are secretly calling reinforcements here.

338
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:24,400
You are right!

339
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:29,400
Oh, what the hell! They must have heard something.

340
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:31,400
Let's go help out.

341
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:33,400
This is totally out of line.

342
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:36,400
This Moominvalley is a peaceful place.

343
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:38,400
The police chief is a joke.

344
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:43,400
Wake up.

345
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:46,400
No wonder, they've pressed.

346
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:50,400
Listen, I think they're real criminals.

347
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:52,400
Hey, look!

348
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:56,400
Oh heaven!

349
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:58,400
Now I understand.

350
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:02,400
They have cunningly used the gem treasure as bait.

351
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:05,400
He looks like a cop.

352
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:08,400
He's wearing a disguise and that's a good thing.

353
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:11,400
Now we will catch the robber in his blood.

354
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:14,400
Are you sure?

355
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:15,400
Tule!

356
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:18,400
Appears to be stolen property.

357
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:21,400
Hop hop hop hop hop hop hop hop hop hop hop hop!

358
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:23,400
You are arrested!

359
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:25,400
Who exactly are you?

360
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:27,400
We have been played thief.

361
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:30,400
Reserve? Am I a nice thief?

362
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:31,400
Shut up!

363
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:33,400
Aa!

364
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:37,400
The helmet looks completely authentic.

365
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:39,400
Recook it later!

366
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:41,400
What?

367
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:44,400
Don't you just say! Launus does not catch criminals.

368
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:47,400
All right, UNCLE, Master of Police!

369
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:53,400
Detective Launo announces that the villain Saaliinen has been arrested and brought here!

370
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:57,400
Well, tell me, Skeneet, you've arrested this time.

371
00:17:57,400 --> 00:18:00,400
Really big!

372
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:02,400
Ai!

373
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:04,840
Oh, the horror!

374
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:13,840
Come on!

375
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:17,400
Who do you think he is?

376
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:20,480
He just happens to be a police chief inspector!

377
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:23,040
Yah! Like that.

378
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:27,120
I'm not surprised. The inspector general is angry.

379
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:30,320
Our police chief is even angrier.

380
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:35,400
Let's take it, when in Moominvalley you always welcome guests this way.

381
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:40,480
Not at all. My humblest apologies, Mr. Inspector General of Police.

382
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:43,560
Launo, apologize for your request!

383
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:45,640
Sorry!

384
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:47,720
Hello! Apologize!

385
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:50,800
Huh! Why me? Don't ask!

386
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:53,880
Sorry! Sorry!

387
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:58,880
For the first time in my life I am arrested as a thief.

388
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:03,960
Do I look very dangerous?

389
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:06,040
No!

390
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:09,120
According to criminals, yes.

391
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:13,200
It's not a disaster to make mistakes when you're young.

392
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:16,280
I like that one!

393
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:20,360
Bro, can you forgive the launto's enthusiasm?

394
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:22,440
Ever.

395
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:28,120
Once all the looted treasures are found, I forgive him.

396
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:32,640
Launo!

397
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:36,720
The police must be energetic and always on their guard.

398
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:39,800
You can't take anything for granted, can you?

399
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:42,880
In that respect, it seems promising.

400
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:45,960
Really?

401
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:50,040
Mr. Chief Inspector, I want to be a good policeman.

402
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:53,400
Remember, I know you better.

403
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:56,480
Ambition is an advantage.

404
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:59,560
Do you want to work with me?

405
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:03,640
In that case, you have to leave Moominvalley.

406
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:10,960
A flying policeman would be suitable for the location.

407
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:23,040
Congratulations.

408
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:25,120
Take care of yourself.

409
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:28,200
Success in your career.

410
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:33,280
My son of the law, always remember to obey the chief inspector of the police even in the smallest matters.

411
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:36,360
Yes sir!

412
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:40,440
I am happy that peace is returning to Moominvalley again.

413
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:43,520
Vieluvi criminals like launon.

414
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:45,600
He he he.

415
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:49,680
I am happy that peace is returning to Moominvalley again.

416
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:51,880
I got close.

417
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:53,960
Come on, Neno.

418
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:56,040
He he he.

419
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:59,120
Hello then, good health everyone.

420
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:03,200
I apologize profusely for my nephew.

421
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:06,280
He he he he It was fun meeting him.

422
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:10,360
I'm relieved I don't have a nephew.

423
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:13,440
And I don't write gibberish.

424
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:16,520
Hello then, Launo. Bye.
