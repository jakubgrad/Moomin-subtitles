1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Moomin with his family and friends was going out on the water in a boat that had been found on the beach.

2
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:23,000
The destination of the trip had not been decided, because it is more fun to travel that way.

3
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Honey we will be back.

4
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Let's hope.

5
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
We don't need that much stuff.

6
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
You never know about the sea.

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Well, no, but...

8
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
There we have to light a campfire.

9
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
We collect trees from the island.

10
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Yes, but it's tiring if it's raining or if the island is bare.

11
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
It's not an adventure after all.

12
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Excursion life can be nice too.

13
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Hey, screw it up!

14
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Hey!

15
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Moomin!

16
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Hey niskunÃ¤iti!

17
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Could you have fallen?

18
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Pops.

19
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Be more careful or you will hurt yourself.

20
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
It was good practice.

21
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Is your brother coming?

22
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
He is obsessed with his blue copies.

23
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Oh, boys, let's hit the water in a real sailboat.

24
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Is it ready?

25
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
This doesn't look like it!

26
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Shall we take it all in?

27
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
I just came up with this.

28
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Moomin, where exactly are we going?

29
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
We don't know that.

30
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Emme.

31
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Hemuli!

32
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Did you find a rarity?

33
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,000
I don't. I'm afraid I already have this in my collection.

34
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Jeez, are you guys moving?

35
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
We're going on a boat trip.

36
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Oh yes! And no one objects.

37
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
No.

38
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
But why do you need so many struggles?

39
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
There are still many here.

40
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
To the sails!

41
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Anchors up!

42
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
To the sails!

43
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Go for it!

44
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Anchors up!

45
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
To the port!

46
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
To the port!

47
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Haven't the Moomins come yet?

48
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
They don't!

49
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Isn't it a great day?

50
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Where are we going?

51
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
It hasn't been decided yet.

52
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
I don't want to go anywhere far.

53
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Why don't you?

54
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
I'm not a good swimmer.

55
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,000
If the ship gets into trouble at sea, I'd just be a burden.

56
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Look at the weather.

57
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,000
There is not the slightest chance of a storm.

58
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Thanks. All aboard.

59
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Mummy Moomin.

60
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Myy.

61
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Nzkamuikkun.

62
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Niskuneiti.

63
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Hemuli.

64
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Let's go.

65
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Are you going too?

66
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Moomin Mappa said that we will stop on an island.

67
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
I could collect rare plants.

68
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Speed up the hairpin.

69
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
The boat is completely.

70
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Yes, you can join too.

71
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Go a day while waiting.

72
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Maybe that trickle broke Kameli's back.

73
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Fool. The boat could carry many more.

74
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Do you see?

75
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Yes, one can still fit. Isn't that right, dad?

76
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Of course. The sea is almost calm.

77
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Let's go.

78
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Let's go.

79
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Let's go.

80
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Let's go.

81
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Let's go.

82
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Kerquom 2004

83
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Let's go.

84
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Hu approval.

85
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Hu approval.

86
00:04:52,000 --> 00:05:07,340
Mecca

87
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:09,340
Worried about Niinus!

88
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:16,340
A pinch should have come along too.

89
00:05:16,340 --> 00:05:18,340
The trick is the Janis pants!

90
00:05:18,340 --> 00:05:20,340
Well, he's pretty bad at swimming now.

91
00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:22,340
Besides, he eats too much.

92
00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:39,340
This is life.

93
00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:41,340
It is.

94
00:05:49,340 --> 00:05:51,340
Oh, we've gotten into trouble.

95
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:55,340
There's nothing to do but start rowing.

96
00:05:55,340 --> 00:05:57,340
Shouldn't.

97
00:05:57,340 --> 00:05:59,340
Shouldn't.

98
00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:01,340
Shouldn't.

99
00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:03,340
Shouldn't.

100
00:06:03,340 --> 00:06:05,340
No.

101
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:07,340
There's nothing to do but start rowing.

102
00:06:07,340 --> 00:06:09,340
Shouldn't.

103
00:06:09,340 --> 00:06:11,340
Muikkunen, take the oar.

104
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:13,340
Clear.

105
00:06:15,340 --> 00:06:17,340
I row faster.

106
00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:19,340
See Souda briskly.

107
00:06:21,340 --> 00:06:23,340
Don't even bother with our work.

108
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:25,340
We're moving, albeit slowly.

109
00:06:25,340 --> 00:06:27,340
There were galleys.

110
00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:29,340
There must be a strong current at this point.

111
00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:31,340
Strong current.

112
00:06:31,340 --> 00:06:35,340
Oh my goodness, I didn't get a new plant this time.

113
00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:41,340
Throw the fishing line into the water in the nose and start collecting seaweed.

114
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:43,340
Whistle the wind.

115
00:06:43,340 --> 00:06:47,340
Many a sailor has drowned at the bottom.

116
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:49,340
Oh, look.

117
00:06:49,340 --> 00:06:51,340
There's an island over there.

118
00:06:53,340 --> 00:06:57,340
Too small to do anything there.

119
00:06:57,340 --> 00:06:59,340
Not for me!

120
00:07:13,340 --> 00:07:17,340
Aha, even if I don't row, we move forward.

121
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:19,340
The wind has picked up.

122
00:07:23,340 --> 00:07:25,340
Look, beautiful island.

123
00:07:25,340 --> 00:07:27,340
Sata Maki is pretty good.

124
00:07:27,340 --> 00:07:31,340
I bet there are completely unknown plants here.

125
00:07:31,340 --> 00:07:33,340
Watch out for wild beasts and cannibals.

126
00:07:33,340 --> 00:07:39,340
I'm dying to get a cup of coffee.

127
00:07:39,340 --> 00:07:43,340
Someone gets to go look for driftwood on the beach.

128
00:07:43,340 --> 00:07:47,340
Dad, I'm jumping rope.

129
00:07:55,340 --> 00:07:57,340
The goods were needed.

130
00:07:57,340 --> 00:08:01,340
We live an excursion life, but comfortably.

131
00:08:01,340 --> 00:08:05,340
Perhaps we are the first on this island.

132
00:08:07,340 --> 00:08:09,340
Oh, thank you.

133
00:08:09,340 --> 00:08:11,340
What else?

134
00:08:11,340 --> 00:08:13,340
The island should be explored.

135
00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:15,340
I'm going on a research trip.

136
00:08:15,340 --> 00:08:17,340
Explore all locations.

137
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:19,340
Let's go on a research trip.

138
00:08:19,340 --> 00:08:21,340
What?

139
00:08:21,340 --> 00:08:23,340
Explore all locations.

140
00:08:23,340 --> 00:08:25,340
Are you coming along?

141
00:08:25,340 --> 00:08:27,340
I'll stay with grandma.

142
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:31,340
Here comes the wood for the bonfire of the shipwrecked.

143
00:08:31,340 --> 00:08:33,340
Oh, how much.

144
00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:39,340
I think the island is uninhabited.

145
00:08:39,340 --> 00:08:43,340
I wouldn't be surprised at all. I haven't seen anyone.

146
00:08:43,340 --> 00:08:45,340
I am.

147
00:08:45,340 --> 00:08:47,340
Who?

148
00:08:47,340 --> 00:08:49,340
Medium size, White.

149
00:08:49,340 --> 00:08:51,340
What do you mean medium size?

150
00:08:51,340 --> 00:08:53,340
Just like me.

151
00:08:53,340 --> 00:08:55,340
What did it look like?

152
00:08:55,340 --> 00:08:57,340
White to the pool, like I said.

153
00:08:57,340 --> 00:08:59,340
A bit like a ghost.

154
00:08:59,340 --> 00:09:01,340
You just haven't seen the visions, little one.

155
00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:03,340
And you don't believe me?

156
00:09:03,340 --> 00:09:07,340
I believe. You think you saw something.

157
00:09:07,340 --> 00:09:11,340
Three wakes and seven sows.

158
00:09:11,340 --> 00:09:15,340
An exciting find.

159
00:09:19,340 --> 00:09:23,340
That must be it.

160
00:09:43,340 --> 00:09:45,340
What a find.

161
00:09:45,340 --> 00:09:49,340
This island is bursting with rarities.

162
00:09:55,340 --> 00:09:57,340
What is that?

163
00:10:05,340 --> 00:10:13,340
Mr. Dad, the barometer shows rain and a storm broke apparently.

164
00:10:15,340 --> 00:10:25,340
Hey, what the hell are you guys?

165
00:10:25,340 --> 00:10:31,340
This is your barometer, right?

166
00:10:33,340 --> 00:10:35,340
Let's go your way.

167
00:10:35,340 --> 00:10:39,340
Don't trample all the plants on them.

168
00:10:39,340 --> 00:10:45,340
I think Myy has seen the hat.

169
00:10:45,340 --> 00:10:49,340
Are Hattivats ghost-like?

170
00:10:49,340 --> 00:10:53,340
Yes, they look a bit like ghosts, but they are harmless.

171
00:10:55,340 --> 00:10:57,340
Someone was clearly yelling for help.

172
00:10:57,340 --> 00:10:59,340
In the heme of c oli thalassemia.

173
00:10:59,340 --> 00:11:01,340
Let's go away.

174
00:11:01,340 --> 00:11:03,340
Help, help, ouch.

175
00:11:29,340 --> 00:11:33,340
How many hattiwatts?

176
00:11:33,340 --> 00:11:35,340
Hemuli of the park.

177
00:11:35,340 --> 00:11:37,340
Help me go down.

178
00:11:37,340 --> 00:11:43,340
What have you been doing when the Hattivats are so angry?

179
00:11:43,340 --> 00:11:47,340
Nothing else when I knocked this lock.

180
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:49,340
It hardly angered Hattivati.

181
00:11:49,340 --> 00:11:53,340
I also clicked on the barometer to see what kind of weather was coming.

182
00:11:53,340 --> 00:11:58,340
Maybe the Hattivats thought you were going to steal the barometer.

183
00:11:58,340 --> 00:12:00,340
Nuhuska muikkunken.

184
00:12:00,340 --> 00:12:04,340
Tell them I don't want a barometer.

185
00:12:04,340 --> 00:12:06,340
How do we expel them?

186
00:12:06,340 --> 00:12:07,340
Hurry up.

187
00:12:07,340 --> 00:12:09,340
I'll slide down.

188
00:12:09,340 --> 00:12:11,340
We have to do something.

189
00:12:11,340 --> 00:12:13,340
I'm thinking.

190
00:12:13,340 --> 00:12:15,340
Hurry up.

191
00:12:17,340 --> 00:12:19,340
Now I invented Hemuli.

192
00:12:19,340 --> 00:12:26,340
Hattivats cannot see or hear well, but they have a very sensitive sense of touch.

193
00:12:26,340 --> 00:12:29,340
Swing the lock even back.

194
00:12:29,340 --> 00:12:31,340
Did I see that?

195
00:12:31,340 --> 00:12:33,340
Harder.

196
00:12:36,340 --> 00:12:39,340
Do you see? They feel the vibrations of the earth.

197
00:12:39,340 --> 00:12:41,340
Keep rocking.

198
00:12:43,340 --> 00:12:45,340
My hands get heavy when I write.

199
00:12:45,340 --> 00:12:47,340
I'm falling.

200
00:12:48,340 --> 00:12:51,340
Rocking seems to work well.

201
00:12:56,340 --> 00:12:58,340
Hemuli!

202
00:13:08,340 --> 00:13:10,340
Are you OK?

203
00:13:10,340 --> 00:13:12,340
Disgusting creatures.

204
00:13:12,340 --> 00:13:15,340
I'll take their crappy barometer.

205
00:13:15,340 --> 00:13:17,340
It feels.

206
00:13:17,340 --> 00:13:19,340
I'm next.

207
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:21,340
I'm next.

208
00:13:21,340 --> 00:13:23,340
I'm next.

209
00:13:23,340 --> 00:13:25,340
I'll take their crappy barometer.

210
00:13:25,340 --> 00:13:27,340
That's hardly wise.

211
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:30,340
This doesn't even work.

212
00:13:31,340 --> 00:13:33,340
How do you know that?

213
00:13:33,340 --> 00:13:39,340
The weather is great now, but this barometer shows rain and thunderstorms.

214
00:13:43,340 --> 00:13:46,340
Real pancakes instead of canned.

215
00:13:46,340 --> 00:13:48,340
I know what is needed on a trip.

216
00:13:48,340 --> 00:13:52,340
Moominpappa knows how to plan everything so well.

217
00:13:52,340 --> 00:13:55,340
The barometer shows deep low pressure.

218
00:13:55,340 --> 00:13:57,340
There's going to be a storm.

219
00:13:57,340 --> 00:14:01,340
A terrible squall, if the barometer of the hats is intact.

220
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:06,340
Hemuli, yes the barometer may be intact.

221
00:14:08,340 --> 00:14:10,340
Look at the horizon.

222
00:14:16,340 --> 00:14:18,340
A heavy squall is coming up.

223
00:14:18,340 --> 00:14:20,340
Hurry home before it hits.

224
00:14:20,340 --> 00:14:22,340
There is no time, we are in trouble at sea.

225
00:14:24,340 --> 00:14:26,340
What can we do now?

226
00:14:26,340 --> 00:14:29,340
It would be a waste to go home right away.

227
00:14:29,340 --> 00:14:34,340
We haven't even gotten to explore the other side of the island at all.

228
00:14:35,340 --> 00:14:37,340
I want to study hat wadding.

229
00:14:37,340 --> 00:14:40,340
I don't. Absolutely not.

230
00:14:41,340 --> 00:14:43,340
I think we should go.

231
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:45,340
What do you say mom?

232
00:14:45,340 --> 00:14:47,340
Honey, you're the captain.

233
00:14:47,340 --> 00:14:49,340
Good, Annas, while I think about it.

234
00:14:49,340 --> 00:14:51,340
We will stay.

235
00:14:51,340 --> 00:14:53,340
Really?

236
00:14:53,340 --> 00:14:55,340
So hurry up.

237
00:14:55,340 --> 00:14:57,340
We have to do this.

238
00:14:57,340 --> 00:14:59,340
Let's go.

239
00:14:59,340 --> 00:15:01,340
Let's go.

240
00:15:01,340 --> 00:15:03,340
Let's go.

241
00:15:03,340 --> 00:15:05,340
Let's go.

242
00:15:05,340 --> 00:15:07,340
Let's go.

243
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:09,340
Let's go.

244
00:15:09,340 --> 00:15:11,340
Let's go.

245
00:15:11,340 --> 00:15:13,340
Let's go.

246
00:15:13,340 --> 00:15:15,340
Let's go.

247
00:15:15,340 --> 00:15:17,340
Let's go.

248
00:15:17,340 --> 00:15:21,340
So hurry up. We have to set up a tent.

249
00:15:21,340 --> 00:15:23,340
A tent?

250
00:15:23,340 --> 00:15:26,340
Of course. Mummy Moomin has also packed the tent.

251
00:15:26,340 --> 00:15:29,340
Is there? Mom, you're an exaggeration.

252
00:15:30,340 --> 00:15:36,340
First, the sail is trimmed and hauled to the boat's shore.

253
00:15:47,340 --> 00:15:49,340
Prepare.

254
00:15:49,340 --> 00:15:53,340
I don't think the waves reach that far.

255
00:15:53,340 --> 00:15:55,340
Next, the tent.

256
00:15:55,340 --> 00:15:57,340
Don't procrastinate.

257
00:15:59,340 --> 00:16:03,340
Oh hey, maybe this is too much for me.

258
00:16:03,340 --> 00:16:07,340
Not sitting there and resting.

259
00:16:07,340 --> 00:16:09,340
However, I am.

260
00:16:09,340 --> 00:16:11,340
I'm going straight to this tent.

261
00:16:11,340 --> 00:16:13,340
You stay here.

262
00:16:13,340 --> 00:16:15,340
But when you get up,

263
00:16:15,340 --> 00:16:17,340
remember to put the rope on the tree.

264
00:16:17,340 --> 00:16:19,340
Is that right?

265
00:16:19,340 --> 00:16:21,340
You can trust me.

266
00:16:21,340 --> 00:16:23,340
Well, let's get to work.

267
00:16:23,340 --> 00:16:25,340
Oh hemuli parka.

268
00:16:41,340 --> 00:16:43,340
I haven't come across this before.

269
00:16:43,340 --> 00:16:47,340
This is certainly rare.

270
00:16:55,340 --> 00:16:57,340
I'm snuffling.

271
00:16:57,340 --> 00:16:59,340
What does it look like?

272
00:16:59,340 --> 00:17:01,340
There is a gray curtain over the sea.

273
00:17:01,340 --> 00:17:03,340
It will rain soon.

274
00:17:03,340 --> 00:17:05,340
I'm up.

275
00:17:05,340 --> 00:17:07,340
I'm up.

276
00:17:07,340 --> 00:17:09,340
I'm up.

277
00:17:09,340 --> 00:17:11,340
There is a gray curtain over the sea.

278
00:17:11,340 --> 00:17:13,340
It will rain soon.

279
00:17:13,340 --> 00:17:15,340
Let's go before we get wet.

280
00:17:15,340 --> 00:17:17,340
No, no.

281
00:17:17,340 --> 00:17:19,340
What now?

282
00:17:19,340 --> 00:17:21,340
It's so exciting.

283
00:17:21,340 --> 00:17:29,340
It's great to stand on the shore of the bubbling sea and watch the rising storm.

284
00:17:31,340 --> 00:17:33,340
So?

285
00:17:33,340 --> 00:17:35,340
And at the right moment.

286
00:17:35,340 --> 00:17:39,340
So that you avoid getting wet.

287
00:17:39,340 --> 00:17:41,340
Exactly.

288
00:17:45,340 --> 00:17:47,340
What are the Hattivats up to?

289
00:17:47,340 --> 00:17:49,340
They are waiting for a thunderstorm.

290
00:17:49,340 --> 00:17:51,340
Why?

291
00:17:51,340 --> 00:17:55,340
They become electric in a thunderstorm.

292
00:17:55,340 --> 00:17:57,340
Really?

293
00:17:57,340 --> 00:17:59,340
Oh, now it's dripping.

294
00:18:05,340 --> 00:18:07,340
Don't be afraid.

295
00:18:07,340 --> 00:18:09,340
I am your safety.

296
00:18:35,340 --> 00:18:37,340
I am your safety.

297
00:19:05,340 --> 00:19:07,340
A storm.

298
00:19:27,340 --> 00:19:29,340
A thunderbolt struck close by.

299
00:19:29,340 --> 00:19:31,340
Certainly.

300
00:19:31,340 --> 00:19:33,340
The storm is over.

301
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:37,340
from this day.

302
00:19:58,340 --> 00:20:02,340
If you have been stranded on a desert island in a heavy storm,

303
00:20:03,340 --> 00:20:07,340
can't help but wait for the storm to subside.

304
00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:13,340
But if the waves and rising water suck the boat's hull,

305
00:20:14,340 --> 00:20:16,340
does worse.
