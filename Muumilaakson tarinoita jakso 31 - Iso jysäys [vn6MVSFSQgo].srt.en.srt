1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Moomipeikko had a dream.

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:15,000
I think it's nice to float in the sky.

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Oh Moomipeikko look! Oh, we have a lake too!

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
I have never experienced anything so wonderful in my entire life.

5
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Me neither. Only now do you understand the life of birds.

6
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
They always get to enjoy open landscapes.

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
We fly wildly high.

8
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
It scares me. Let's land already.

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Oh my, why did I go along?

10
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I'm not scared!

11
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Niisku, your aircraft is like a fairy tale.

12
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I could build dozens of these.

13
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Niisku, may I direct?

14
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Plastic!

15
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Stink, Can you pilot an aircraft?

16
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Stop now!

17
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
You cause a dangerous situation!

18
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000
I dream of this persecution. I won't die yet.

19
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Father! Mother!

20
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Oh!

21
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
All in all, a remarkable sleep.

22
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Why did my Niisku brother let Haisuli pilot the aircraft.

23
00:01:53,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I'm confused. I was chatting with Niisku, but suddenly there was Stink in his place.

24
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
And that's when the air fire started to heat up, right?

25
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Yes, but it was just a dream.

26
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
It was not a good dream at all.

27
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Niisku's aircraft is starting to need finishing touches.

28
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Why did you have such a dream?

29
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,000
That dream balloon was completely different from Niisku's aircraft.

30
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,000
But what happened to the balloon? Did it keep flying?

31
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,000
I don't know. I canoed it out of sight because I fell.

32
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
You could have turned around to see how it went.

33
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
I didn't get it.

34
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Just don't tell Niisku about your dream. His nerves are starting to fray.

35
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:40,000
I won't tell. And you shouldn't remember a dream either.

36
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Well, now it's finally ready.

37
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Yes, but it hasn't gone live yet.

38
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Do you think there will still be some twists and turns?

39
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
No, of course, but...

40
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Oh, so there are puzzles?

41
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
I can't deny it.

42
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
What is it about?

43
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
From the fuel.

44
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
You said you developed a new efficient fuel.

45
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:10,000
That's what I said, but the power doesn't seem to be enough.

46
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Is your plane not flying?

47
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:19,000
It is possible. Then it's not an aircraft, but an ordinary ship.

48
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:23,000
I hope it's good. At least then it won't fall down.

49
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,000
If I get to fly it, I'll be laughed at.

50
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Or what?

51
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
I'm not laughing at you.

52
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
What about the others? They laugh.

53
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Well, some maybe, but you don't care about that.

54
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:44,000
I went to tell some friends that I'm going to do a public test flight soon.

55
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Your ship is so great that everyone would be happy just to see it.

56
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
But that's not enough for me.

57
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Moomin, I would like to ask you a favor because you are my Sister's best friend.

58
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Well what can I do for you?

59
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:06,000
I want you and only you to be the pilot in the flight of experience.

60
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
No, are you serious?

61
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Hello! Hello! Hello! Hello! Hello! Hello! Hello! Hello! Hello! Hello! Hello! Hello! Hello! Hello! Hello! Hello! Hello! Hello!

62
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Hello! Hello! Hello! Hello! Hello! Hello! Hello! Hello! Hello!

63
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Moomin!

64
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Listen, I get to control Niisku's aircraft as a searcher, so that the steers can smell it.

65
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,000
What exactly were you talking about?

66
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Isn't it difficult to control?

67
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
No, quite easy.

68
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,000
But I have to practice in Niskuk's workshop beforehand.

69
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Does Niisku not come on board at all?

70
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:11,000
He will, of course, but he will examine the engine during the flight.

71
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
I hope everything goes well.

72
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Combustion always does today.

73
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
That's a serious flaw.

74
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Isn't it?

75
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
That's it.

76
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
You hear me, mummy.

77
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Assume that a gusty aircraft takes off.

78
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Of course it will rise.

79
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Yeah, but if it crashes due to air bubbles or fuel problems, so what?

80
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Father!

81
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Mumblebees naturally fly through the air.

82
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,000
One can hurt another, right?

83
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Joo.

84
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
How would it be for Niskunk and you then?

85
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Of course we have parachutes.

86
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Parachutes?

87
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Dad, do you know what a parachute is?

88
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Of course, this is how the lily flutters from the upper air.

89
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Yeah, but we don't need parachutes because the test flight will definitely be successful.

90
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:09,000
And I will be the first pilot in all of Moomin Valley.

91
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Yes?

92
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Good day, son.

93
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Good day.

94
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Good day.

95
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Hello everyone.

96
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Good day.

97
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Good day.

98
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Does the gentleman happen to know where Niisku's workshop is located?

99
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
With pleasure.

100
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Great, Niisku misses time with his aircraft.

101
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Yes, how do you know?

102
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:39,000
I thought that Niisku would have kept his invention a secret.

103
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Share, share, all the cookies worth mentioning in the world have arrived from his work.

104
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Are you inventing too?

105
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Yes, let's be fine.

106
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,000
You must have heard my name before.

107
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
I'm Moominpapa.

108
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Nuuska Muikkunen.

109
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
And I'm Moomin.

110
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Pleasant.

111
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,000
I, for one, am famous for inventing the muffle.

112
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Then the muffle.

113
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Hungry.

114
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Oh, oh, do none of you really know me?

115
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Sorry.

116
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Maybe I have read about you after all.

117
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:26,000
What have you come up with so far?

118
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Oh, oh, I've come up with many things in my life.

119
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:36,000
For example, a button needle that doesn't sting because it has a button at each end.

120
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,000
A newspaper that reads itself.

121
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,000
A wallet that crumbles when you take money out of it.

122
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:46,000
May I introduce you to perhaps my best invention?

123
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
What is that?

124
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Human operated fan brand and wind head.

125
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Absolutely great.

126
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Well, what do you say about my invention?

127
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Well why not?

128
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:17,000
In addition, I have invented a triangular handkerchief,

129
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:22,000
an angular balloon, a seven-hole button, and more.

130
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Otherwise, why do you want to meet, Niisku?

131
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,000
I think one of my inventions could be useful to him.

132
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
From what invention?

133
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Something like that, but when it's seen it's top secret.

134
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Share it, Niiskun Verstas.

135
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
I'll show you.

136
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Oh, thank you.

137
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Niiskun will be amazed for sure.

138
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
I'll leave here then.

139
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:52,000
It's a pleasure to help budding inventors.

140
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Have you seen a triangular handkerchief?

141
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,000
No, and I have no desire to see.

142
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:05,000
What does that inventor have to show Niisku?

143
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Sanopas se.

144
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
So.

145
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,000
The drug troll tells us yes.

146
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Sniffy, can you wait until then?

147
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
In.

148
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Wait, I'll come with you.

149
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,000
I thought we had a guest.

150
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Where has everyone gone?

151
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
This.

152
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
This.

153
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
There's still something.

154
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Father and Snuff.

155
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Father, why did you come here?

156
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
That about...

157
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,000
What do you mean by that?

158
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Niisku and Muhvel have secret things and they wanted to stay together.

159
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
What are they doing inside?

160
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,000
They're chatting, I don't know why.

161
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Too bad.

162
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:28,000
I can't see inside because the news is in front.

163
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Is this the new and efficient fuel?

164
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Yes, although the invention is less original.

165
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:40,000
It's a disappointingly practical power fuel.

166
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:44,000
My ship can only use liquid fuel.

167
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:49,000
It is not a problem when Kimpaleen dissolves ten liters of water,

168
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:52,000
the engine runs for ten hours.

169
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Oh so long.

170
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:58,000
If you live by the word of faith, try it out, even now.

171
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Right away?

172
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:04,000
I guarantee that if you use fuel in solid form,

173
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,000
your ship's engine will run for up to a hundred hours.

174
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
A hundred hours?

175
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,000
If that's true, you're a really big deal.

176
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:16,000
So the last puzzle of my aircraft is solved.

177
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Yes.

178
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,000
The workshop door doesn't even seem to be locked.

179
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Not so.

180
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:27,000
If I want to see Niisku, I can march in.

181
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Do you want to see him then?

182
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
I want to.

183
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Why?

184
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:37,000
I don't want Niiskun to fall into that cookie thread.

185
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
We'll see how it goes soon.

186
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Dad, not the last time.

187
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Don't last.

188
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
We'll see how it goes soon.

189
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Dad, don't be so childish.

190
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,000
I know what they're doing inside.

191
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Don't talk nonsense.

192
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:00,000
It invented putting fuel in the aircraft's tank.

193
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Did you watch?

194
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
I saw it, even though the visibility was poor.

195
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Where were you watching?

196
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
In a crevice where only I can fit.

197
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
I won't tell you before.

198
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
What did they discuss?

199
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
There is no rehentel.

200
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
I'm disappearing, like you already are.

201
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Don't now, Niisku. There is some misconception here.

202
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Shut up.

203
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
I'm disappearing.

204
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Outrageous bullying.

205
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Solid fuel for one hundred hours.

206
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Poor cheater.

207
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Niisku, fine, let me explain.

208
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
No need to explain.

209
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:36,000
I know why you came here to feed me willow rope.

210
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Shit!

211
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Not true.

212
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
I didn't come here to talk soft.

213
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
I already believe.

214
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Fishing rods of happiness.

215
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Foul language.

216
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Niisku, spoil yourself.

217
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Maybe the fuel is not suitable for your vessel.

218
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
It goes with anything?

219
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
The fuel was the snow of the eye.

220
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
The guy just wanted to see my aircraft.

221
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Yes.

222
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Muhveli is a spy.

223
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
What do you mean?

224
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
By the way, did you have any business?

225
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
No longer.

226
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
What a betrayal.

227
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
A muffle is a hummus cookie.

228
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
What?

229
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
I don't know pariah.

230
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
What would be the point of inventing hummocks?

231
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
I can assure you that all my inventions work.

232
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
I have to be teased.

233
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
I have to clean the tank because that so called fuel ruined it.

234
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Goodbye.

235
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Oh.

236
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Niisku Ressuka had a bitter disappointment.

237
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Joo.

238
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
AI Suri.

239
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
I'm doing this for Niisku.

240
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Remember that.

241
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
That side of the matter doesn't interest me one bit.

242
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
I want to tinker with the aircraft.

243
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
The aircraft needs very efficient fuel.

244
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Maybe fuel.

245
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
I am efficient fuel, and Niisku has not managed to get it.

246
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
No.

247
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
But I have invented one.

248
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Guess I'll show you my triangle handkerchief one day.

249
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
The important thing now is that we don't dissolve the fuel in the water.

250
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Can't get the door open already?

251
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
It's open.

252
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Good.

253
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
I'll put it as a trap.

254
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
I want to direct.

255
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
to an altitude of 2000 meters.

256
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
ha Isu Li, still suli.

257
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Altitude 2500 meters.

258
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
ha Isu Li.

259
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Now what again?

260
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Try to stay in your skin.

261
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Start the engine as soon as I give the order.

262
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Clear.

263
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Welcome.

264
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Welcome.

265
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Welcome.

266
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Welcome.

267
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Clear.

268
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
It's this button.

269
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Not yet.

270
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
A drop of water just spoils it.

271
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Made it clear.

272
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Do I start?

273
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
No.

274
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Clear.

275
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
So, now start.

276
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
At the behest of.

277
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Are you sure you want to start the engine?

278
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Starter.

279
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:24,000
The engine doesn't even suck! Did you miss the piece I showed you?

280
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Well, I twisted it! Exactly that piece!

281
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Was it wrong?

282
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:35,000
Long live the fools there! My invention career is at stake!

283
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Still won't start? Well, not now!

284
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Nothing happens!

285
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,000
It was a blast to let you in there! I'll come myself!

286
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Dear Mr. Guess, there's only one more piece left here!

287
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
What?

288
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Today, the guidance was down to the last piece!

289
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Now it hums! Now it hums!

290
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Aha! Let's go save the day!

291
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Amazing! I'm not surprised, but certainly happy!

292
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:18,000
I wish you could see that this is my big moment!

293
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Come on, get up so I can steer!

294
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:29,000
The ship rises like a phoenix bird towards the stars!

295
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:33,000
Come on, get up so I can steer!

296
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:39,000
The ship rises like a phoenix bird towards the stars!

297
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:44,000
My historical invention! Hooray, hooray, hooray!

298
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Well, I'll lie down then!

299
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:06,000
Don't get up now, let's fly!

300
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Shocking power! The engine explodes!

301
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,000
My bolt is blowing up the engine!

302
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
It stinks, the engine explodes!

303
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
The ship takes off!

304
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
Go ahead before it crashes!

305
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:29,000
It's a bit of a shame, but my boyfriend is a boy after all!

306
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Oh!

307
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
Oh!

308
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Hmm...

309
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
Oh!

310
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:07,000
Selle has seen your small size, but sieve.

311
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:12,000
I had no intention of destroying the ship in the first place.

312
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:17,000
Of course not. I would like to ask a small favor from a big cookie.

313
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:23,000
Could you come up with something non-explosive against the rosy-sucking booths?

314
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:27,000
It's not an art or a piece of cake.

315
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:31,000
It's not an art or a piece of cake.

316
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,000
I would so like to fly!

317
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,000
You can do it bravely, Nisku.

318
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
Make a new one.

319
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:51,000
Nisku, you don't guess, but I had such a dream that I was flying.

320
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:54,000
No, you just flew. Well, that's interesting.

321
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:58,000
Yes, it flew. And it wasn't like that, hey?

322
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Yes, but that flight vector was quite different from Nisku's aircraft.

323
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
What was it like?

324
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,000
Well, if you would describe it briefly.

325
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:15,000
It was round and at the bottom there was something like a currant.

326
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:18,000
For I flew over the mountains.

327
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Oh round. And there was a basket at the bottom.

328
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:26,000
It was so. Round and basket.

329
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
Oh round.

330
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
Nisku, what happened to you?

331
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:40,000
Thanks for the coffee. Something interesting seems to be brewing in my brain.

332
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,000
So thank you and see you soon.

333
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
Oh, he's busy.

334
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
I feel that look in his eyes.

335
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:51,000
You won't get a reasonable answer from my brother for at least a month.

336
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
That's what I think too.

337
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:56,000
But in vain he so hard for the horses.

338
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,000
It is what it is.

339
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:02,000
Niskula is Nisku kujeet.

340
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,000
The explosion did not depress Nisku for long.

341
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:11,000
Let's see what the next aircraft will be like.

342
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
Round.

343
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
Round.

344
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
Round.
