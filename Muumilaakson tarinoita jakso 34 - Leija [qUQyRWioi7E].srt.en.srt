1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Winter was coming, Moomin began to get restless.

2
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Snuff Muikkunen!

3
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,000
At this time of the year, Nuuska Muikkunen always went to wander south.

4
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Good morning dad.

5
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Are you on your feet?

6
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Joo.

7
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,000
We are buried in leaves from last night's wind.

8
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,000
So. Winter is approaching, but the campfire warms you.

9
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
So warm.

10
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I guess we're going to hibernate again, aren't we?

11
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Yeah, of course.

12
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
As per usual.

13
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:32,000
If Nuuska Muikkunen takes me south, can I watch over the winter?

14
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Can I have a father?

15
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
I think Nuuska Muikkunen doesn't want a company.

16
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
But if I make him want to?

17
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
No, don't. Nuuska Muikku should not be pressured.

18
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Why?

19
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:54,000
He is a hermit character. Only in winter does he have the opportunity to enjoy solitude.

20
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
I know, but...

21
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Nuuska Muikkunen likes you very much.

22
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000
And that's why he stays in Moomin Valley for the rest of the year.

23
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Deep down, however, he is a vagabond and needs his winter solitude to recover from us.

24
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:19,000
I can understand how you feel, but if you keep going along, he'll feel bothered.

25
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I'll leave Nuuska Muikkunen alone.

26
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Don't grow up.

27
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Well, why doesn't the fish eat? I haven't caught a decent catch in days.

28
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
The air has cooled.

29
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
So.

30
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
when are you leaving

31
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Yes?

32
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
You're leaving again.

33
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Joo.

34
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Can I ask for something?

35
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
What?

36
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Let me know when you leave.

37
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
But...

38
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:15,000
I will always be sad when you leave, even though I know you will return.

39
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:20,000
So. I'm sad too, that's why I thought I'd sneak out this year.

40
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,000
But I will be even sadder if I hear that you have left.

41
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,000
I want to say goodbye to you properly and wish you a good trip.

42
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Please notify us of your departure.

43
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Oh, it's about time, if I don't go hiking until after you're already hibernating.

44
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Yeah. That's a good idea. In that case, we wouldn't divorce at all.

45
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Hmm. Not really. I'll be back before you wake up.

46
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Yeah! Let's do it boldly!

47
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Hi! Moomin!

48
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Hi Nipsu!

49
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Moomin! Come on! I'm talking about the stuck-on hoody!

50
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
What is it?

51
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:11,000
I don't know. Niskunet and moles found. It's so high we can't get it down.

52
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Well, I can come.

53
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Carefully!

54
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
I found it!

55
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Well, it's a kite.

56
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
What?

57
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
A kite to fly.

58
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
It is wingless.

59
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,000
The kite is tied to the end of the string and released into the wind.

60
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Watch out, Moomin!

61
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Dream, dream!

62
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Good!

63
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Good!

64
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Be careful here!

65
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Let it come!

66
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Is this a kite?

67
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
That's a total bummer!

68
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,000
It can certainly be fixed.

69
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:41,000
The string has broken from the kite when someone was flying it. Then the wind has brought it here.

70
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Let's start the repair work!

71
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Let's have a good time, shall we?

72
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
It just looks like junk to me!

73
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
We will have fun.

74
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Is that a kite?

75
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Can it be fixed?

76
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
I fancy.

77
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:05,000
What a strange looking kite. It must have traveled from somewhere far away.

78
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Well, is it going to be a dick?

79
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Of course.

80
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Then to work! We help you!

81
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:19,000
I can fix a kite without your help, if only you can find me a really long and strong, but thin thread.

82
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,000
I think I have a suitable thread.

83
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Good. Then I'll get to work right away.

84
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Good.

85
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Then I'll get to work right away.

86
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Good. Then I'll get to work right away.

87
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Good.

88
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Then I'll get to work right away.

89
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Good.

90
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Then I'll get to work right away.

91
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Good.

92
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Then I'll get to work right away.

93
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Good.

94
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Then I'll get to work right away.

95
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Good.

96
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Then I'll get to work right away.

97
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Good.

98
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Then I'll get to work right away.

99
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Good.

100
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Then I'll get to work right away.

101
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Good.

102
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Good.

103
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Then I'll get to work right away.

104
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Good.

105
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Then I'll get to work right away.

106
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Good.

107
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Then I'll get to work right away.

108
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Good.

109
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Then I'll get to work right away.

110
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Good.

111
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Then I'll get to work right away.

112
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Good.

113
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Then I'll get to work right away.

114
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Good.

115
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,860
Then I'll get to work right away.

116
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:19,000
Good.

117
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,640
Then I'll get to work right away.

118
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Good.

119
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Then I'll get to work right away.

120
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:30,000
How exciting, I haven't flown a kite in ages.

121
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,000
You are a child again.

122
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Nisku, okay?

123
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Yeah, who flies first?

124
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Me of course.

125
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:43,000
All right. Moomin-Pekko, hold the kite.

126
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Did I see that? Like that. I'm ready in a pinch.

127
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:51,000
All right, don't leave until I say so.

128
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Now, Moomin-Pekko.

129
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
You have to put in runs.

130
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,000
When the wind catches the kite, you start to let go of the string.

131
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,000
All right. Moomin-Pekko, hold the kite again.

132
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Alright please. I'll let go.

133
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Now I'm leaving. Let's let go.

134
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Will a kite rise?

135
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Didn't rise.

136
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Stop it, you're breaking the kite.

137
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Hey listen, the kite is really bad.

138
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,000
And it isn't, but the wind is too weak.

139
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,000
I guess you're right, too bad.

140
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,000
The wind was so strong yesterday.

141
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Is that okay?

142
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Maybe it will be windy enough soon.

143
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Higher!

144
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,000
It feels heavy, shall we let go?

145
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Let's get there little by little.

146
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Clear.

147
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Nipsu, let me set the record straight, you can't.

148
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,000
You don't know better than that.

149
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,000
You are too light to hold a kite.

150
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
I am!

151
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
I am!

152
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
I am!

153
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
I am!

154
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,000
You are too light to hold a kite.

155
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
I am!

156
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,000
I believe in Moomin, a kite will lift you into the air.

157
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
A pinch.

158
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
So what?

159
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Could I fly sometimes?

160
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Dad would enjoy it.

161
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Don't run away.

162
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:11,000
I did this before Nipsu was even born.

163
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Hupsista.

164
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Moominpappa boil, coil, boil.

165
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Well, I'm boiling.

166
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Look.

167
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Oh.

168
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,000
It certainly wasn't my fault.

169
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Of course not, but the wind is so open up there that we have to move the center of gravity a little lower.

170
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Dad, the kite is fine.

171
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
A kite could fly me.

172
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Now.

173
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Well, now you can't run around anymore.

174
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Not so.

175
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
What now?

176
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:26,000
No more jumping on a kite.

177
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Hell no.

178
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
The flight characteristics of the kite are then defined.

179
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:36,000
If I hold onto the kite firmly, it will lift me to the heights.

180
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Maybe, but it's dangerous. After all, with what a rush the kite came down.

181
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Like I just said the kite doesn't fall.

182
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Still.

183
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:50,000
I do what I want, but others must not notice, or they try to prevent right.

184
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Sell, don't bother.

185
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Sell, it would be better if you didn't go.

186
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Next time when...

187
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
What are you doing?

188
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Nothing, just told Nipsu that the kite won't fly down anymore.

189
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
No, like when Niisku grazed it.

190
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
There are no guarantees.

191
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Nipsu, do you support a kite?

192
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Light.

193
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Moomin, do you still want to fly?

194
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,000
I want to. This time I'm letting go of everything.

195
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Nipsu, do you support the kite?

196
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
You carry the bread.

197
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Nipsu, I trust you.

198
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
You can me.

199
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Can you survive this?

200
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Sure, dude.

201
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
I'm not so sure.

202
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Close your eyes to whom you cannot look.

203
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Nipsu, let go when I say hep.

204
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Clear.

205
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Well, hep.

206
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Hi, I ran out of thread already.

207
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Hovering high.

208
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
It's windy higher up.

209
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Handsome.

210
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Handsome.

211
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Handsome.

212
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Handsome.

213
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Handsome.

214
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Handsome.

215
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Handsome.

216
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Handsome.

217
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Handsome.

218
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Handsome.

219
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Handsome.

220
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
bathing

221
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,480
Iha sucks

222
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Iha sucks

223
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Sullatt?

224
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Exercise

225
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Exercise

226
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
E.g.

227
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Does S have

228
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
It's Heidi

229
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
You can't help it

230
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Driver

231
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Freight

232
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
It's not that bird.

233
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Probably some rag.

234
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
I guess so.

235
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Nipsu, you can't see the back of the kite?

236
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
I can't even see, my eyes are closed.

237
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
It's not a rag.

238
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
But sell.

239
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Maybe it's because you don't see him here.

240
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Why would it sell?

241
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
I don't know anything, I didn't see.

242
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Nipsu, you too.

243
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
Sell, I was itching to get on the kite.

244
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Moomin, pull the kite down slowly.

245
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Be quiet Moomin, be careful not to break the thread with a gust of wind.

246
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
It's grandma's best yarn.

247
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
I'm worried about the knot.

248
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
From which node?

249
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
From the knot of the new thread and the old tail.

250
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
The string lasts, but what about the knot?

251
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
So what?

252
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
A knot is, you see, always a knot.

253
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Don't let go, sell.

254
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Windy as hell, watch out.

255
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
If puto is from here, then I'll be a convert.

256
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Sell, stay in your fields.

257
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
I have no problem.

258
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
We are almost on the ground.

259
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
The knot was opened.

260
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Come on. A pinch!

261
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
Nisku, get your act together.

262
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Yeah yeah

263
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
A pinch, fire.

264
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
A pinch!

265
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
A pinch, fire.

266
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
A pinch, fire.

267
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
A pinch, fire.

268
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
A pinch, fire.

269
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
A pinch, fire.

270
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
A pinch, fire.

271
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Myy drifts in the direction of the lonely mountains.

272
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,000
Okay, open the door, mom.

273
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:43,000
I really hope that Myy is invincible.

274
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Five to five, I'm on my way!

275
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Oh, it's going to be a long journey home to the lonely mountains.

276
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:04,000
My! My!

277
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
Now he was being driven towards the woods.

278
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:09,000
If he falls into a tree, he is saved.

279
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
I don't see Sell anywhere.

280
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:16,000
In my opinion, this is the direction he flew.

281
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
What now?

282
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:25,000
I'm starting to feel that Myy has already hit the ground running.

283
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Oops, it's not. He floats in that sky.

284
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
What is it?

285
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
I probably saw something.

286
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
Do I sell?

287
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:43,000
I don't. Just as if a magician had attached a panther on his back.

288
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
Ai.

289
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
Did you see?

290
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Would you like to sell?

291
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
Not just a magician.

292
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
I saw it too.

293
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:59,000
Forget the magician. We are looking for a sale.

294
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:11,000
Why can't this rebellion land?

295
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
My bun!

296
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
Where is Myy now?

297
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:41,000
Nothing will come of this. We poke around in vain.

298
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
My bun!

299
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
My bun!

300
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
My bun!

301
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:53,000
The print will come. We poke around in vain.

302
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
Hey, sit down.

303
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
Selling?

304
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
There it is.

305
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
The head can even be wet.

306
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
Yes, but...

307
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:17,000
Myinkappa will surely find little Myin.

308
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
Myy?

309
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Here I am!

310
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
I knew that Onni follows Mya.

311
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
Myy will not disappear from this world.

312
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:45,000
But maybe Myyle was right that his hair got a ride.

313
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:51,000
I didn't see Sell.

314
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
Moomin, be careful!

315
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
Use your hands!

316
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
Help! Dad helps!

317
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
Moomin was finally rescued.

318
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:29,000
But pretty sure he had taken worse bumps than Myyn.
