1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
I have a big load of laundry waiting.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
A day to talk about for a long time.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Really. Moominma was humming even more than usual.

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Really. Moominma was humming even more than usual.

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Moominma was humming even more than usual.

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Oh.

7
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Hemuli investigated whether the rain had brought out new plants.

8
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
This plant shouldn't bloom anymore.

9
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Last year, quite a bit. Wait a minute.

10
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Right. Blooms a month later than last year.

11
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Hi Hemuli. Good morning.

12
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
What did you do?

13
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
He has found a plant again.

14
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Hemuli.

15
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Oh, you're there.

16
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Glad the rain finally stopped.

17
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
We go to collect mushrooms.

18
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Good idea. There are impossible mushrooms in the forest over there.

19
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I didn't expect to see that plant here.

20
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
It needs to be studied carefully.

21
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
I'm kind of interested in a plant.

22
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
And not all of them are even pretty.

23
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
And no edibles.

24
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:40,000
What luck. Another one too.

25
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I don't see even a glimpse of a mushroom in you.

26
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Me neither.

27
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Let's go deeper into the forest.

28
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Let's see who collects the most.

29
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
I win.

30
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,000
The one who collects the least gets to take the buckets home.

31
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
I am a friend.

32
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
I am a friend.

33
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
I am a friend.

34
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
I am a friend.

35
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
I am a friend.

36
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:25,000
I caught the biggest mushroom catch.

37
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
I guess it's the quality and not the quantity.

38
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
My mushrooms are edible.

39
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Mother promised to make mushroom stew.

40
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Let's all go eat.

41
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Hurrah!

42
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
I love mushroom stew.

43
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Oh the spring of life! I brutally saw mushrooms.

44
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:48,000
We have to save some or we get to eat mushrooms for the whole week.

45
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
What is yours?

46
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Nose itches. Come to think of it, I haven't had a hay fever in years.

47
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Oh, what's causing that glow.

48
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:05,000
I have never seen this mushroom before.

49
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Well, neither do I.

50
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
The mushroom didn't glow with Takuu when it was put in the cocoon.

51
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
How does it taste?

52
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
You should never eat unknown mushrooms.

53
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
I'm going to lay them all out here.

54
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
I got the mushroom book.

55
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:32,000
It's not quite that. That mushroom is not in the book.

56
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Images may be inaccurate. Browse again.

57
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:42,000
You won't find that in the book. If it's a new species.

58
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Joo.

59
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
It has been found!

60
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Wouldn't it be best to ask Hemul?

61
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
I brought him here.

62
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
I'll come along.

63
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
A new species of mushroom.

64
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Moominpa said you should come and see those mushrooms.

65
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
And right there!

66
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
All right. I will come.

67
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Please wait for the reference works.

68
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
This and this.

69
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Sorry to keep you waiting.

70
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Let's get rid of the twigs and pine cones.

71
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Well, how about mushrooms?

72
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
They are a new species at Takuu.

73
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Our name will appear in the newspaper.

74
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
And the name of the mushroom will be ehkuvat myiha pero.

75
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Isn't there a hit name?

76
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,000
And it isn't. The mushroom is called Nipsu rousku.

77
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
I can't find a mushroom in the library either.

78
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
May indeed be a new species.

79
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
We get fame.

80
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:50,000
I want a statue of me put in the Academy of the road.

81
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
I need to get a bigger statue.

82
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,000
The statue must be beautiful and collectable.

83
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Don't get excited prematurely.

84
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Many things still need to be checked.

85
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Moominma's mushroom soup is the best in the world.

86
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
I love this recipe.

87
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Impossibly good.

88
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Thanks to the hardworking mushroom pickers.

89
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Hemuli, Would you still like it?

90
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
No thanks.

91
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Moominpapa, can I borrow the study?

92
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:27,000
You can. I can't work on a full stomach.

93
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Thanks. So I'm leaving.

94
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
How about a cup of coffee?

95
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
No, no, no.

96
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Not for me either. There was no empty stomach left.

97
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Will Hemuli stay with us for the night?

98
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Very possible.

99
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,000
How come those mushrooms haven't hurt before?

100
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,000
How come those mushrooms haven't hurt my eyes before?

101
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Although I have been there often.

102
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,000
They may have come from space.

103
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:08,000
The spores have been floating in the universe for millions of years.

104
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Just hardly.

105
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
I'm going to take a guest year.

106
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Do it. This hay fever, or whatever it is, is taking all my strength.

107
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,000
You better go to bed papa.

108
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Good suggestion.

109
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Oh, oh.

110
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
You take this to Hemul.

111
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Hemuli, Hemuli.

112
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
He has fallen asleep.

113
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Of course it takes power.

114
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Hemuli doesn't die. Can't hear.

115
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,000
I guess I checked for a moment.

116
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Look. As if the mushrooms had changed.

117
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
What? Oh.

118
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Amazing.

119
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Oh, oh. The cap has changed shape and the color has intensified.

120
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
A strange phenomenon. Oops.

121
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
The sponge shakes.

122
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Oh.

123
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Mushrooms smoke.

124
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Fungal spores, probably.

125
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,000
I don't tend to spread them anymore.

126
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
And there are a lot of spores.

127
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:45,000
You see. Now the caps have become star-shaped.

128
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Interesting.

129
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Wait a minute. Now it looks more familiar.

130
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,000
A very interesting mushroom.

131
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Listen, Hemul.

132
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
So?

133
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Isn't that the one?

134
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Oh right, Mar. That's what it looks like when it's older.

135
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:07,000
There is no picture of the young mushroom in the book.

136
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
We're not going to be famous.

137
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Yeah, it's not a new species.

138
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:16,000
In the northern mountains, mushrooms grow abundantly in rainy summers.

139
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
I'm terribly tired.

140
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:23,000
The mushroom seems to explode and spread its spores over a wide area.

141
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
It makes me tired too.

142
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:32,000
If spores get out of your body, then...

143
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
So what happens?

144
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,000
No clue. Let's continue tomorrow.

145
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Good. Tomorrow.

146
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Now I don't like to listen.

147
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,000
I'll sleep like a baby for sure.

148
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:49,000
It's too much trouble to go to the weather.

149
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:53,000
The room should be tidied up, but...

150
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Kaiserehti not tomorrow either.

151
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Oh, it's raining again.

152
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:11,000
This year we have received more rain than necessary.

153
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:19,000
The upstairs windows must be closed.

154
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,000
That I wouldn't have been able to fly.

155
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,000
It started to get so weak.

156
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Has the top spiral always been this far?

157
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Has the top spiral always been this far?

158
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Let it be five through the window.

159
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Let's sit down to rest first.

160
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,000
And then I close the windows.

161
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Has the top spiral always been this far?

162
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Has the top spiral always been this far?

163
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Has the top spiral always been this far?

164
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Has the top spiral always been this far?

165
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Has the top spiral always been this far?

166
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Has the top spiral always been this far?

167
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Has the top spiral always been this far?

168
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Has the top spiral always been this far?

169
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Oh oh.

170
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Mom, mom, what's wrong.

171
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Oh good morning papa.

172
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Mom, what does this mean? Why are you sleeping here?

173
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Your forehead feels a little hot.

174
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,000
You don't have a cold at all.

175
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Ekohan.

176
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Oh, what's yours?

177
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,000
So tired I couldn't open the door.

178
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
I was waiting for you to open.

179
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,000
And apparently I fell asleep while waiting.

180
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
You woke me up.

181
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Special type.

182
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:18,000
It's true that you catch a cold when you sleep on a cool landing.

183
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Mars immediately to bed.

184
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
I obey from papakuula.

185
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Oh, just like that.

186
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,000
What happened to mom?

187
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Wake up, Moomin.

188
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,000
The boy is up early.

189
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Moomin, Do you sleep here?

190
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
And Hemuli too.

191
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Good morning.

192
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Good morning dad.

193
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Have you stayed up all night studying mushrooms?

194
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Are we?

195
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
No, before it.

196
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Moomin, something is coming to see mothers' trouble.

197
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Joo.

198
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,000
I don't think you're fine either?

199
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
I am.

200
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Then come quickly, quickly!

201
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Don't be so busy, Papa Moomin.

202
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
What?

203
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Don't get excited.

204
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Mamma is the same if she sleeps a little.

205
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
What's wrong with you?

206
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Now try to wake up.

207
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:32,000
I think I'm awake.

208
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:37,000
But I'm not at all sure if it's comfortable for me.

209
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Listen, Moomin papa.

210
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,000
I'm still taking doubles today.

211
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,000
I have to agree that you look tired.

212
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Hey, look, the mushrooms have changed shape.

213
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Oh yeah, I remember something like that.

214
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Too troublesome to try to remember.

215
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:00,000
I'd much rather just go rogue.

216
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Hey, that's the mushroom in this picture.

217
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:10,000
The mushroom is sometimes called the knockout mushroom.

218
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Being protected from rain strengthens its properties.

219
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:17,000
When the spores enter the body, they cause restlessness.

220
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:21,000
That's the explanation. That's why everyone is so sleepy.

221
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:27,000
How nasty spores? What the hell am I doing to you?

222
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:30,000
The forest is still full of those mushrooms.

223
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:34,000
And there have been more since yesterday's rain.

224
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:38,000
If they dust their spores in Moominvalley, everyone will get sleeping sickness.

225
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,000
I find it enjoyable in the meadows.

226
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
And it's not!

227
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Moomin goblin, where are those mushrooms located?

228
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,000
It's not that easy to explain.

229
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Here is a pen and papers. Mark the locations of the mushrooms.

230
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:58,000
But then I should move my hand.

231
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:02,000
All right. You say, I'll move my hand. Does it fit?

232
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Yeah, yeah.

233
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,000
First, let's go straight.

234
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:11,000
I see. Straight from the Moomin house.

235
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
So what?

236
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Directly?

237
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Night straight?

238
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Directly or directly?

239
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Directly and directly.

240
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
I ran out of paper already.

241
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Let's forget the map. Just tell me.

242
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:31,000
It's terribly tedious to try to remember.

243
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Johan is now. So what do I do?

244
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Well, Moomin the goblin.

245
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Remember to say when you have to turn.

246
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Yeah, yeah.

247
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:49,000
It is said in Kerja that if you manage to collect all the mushrooms,

248
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:52,000
they won't grow back for maybe a hundred years.

249
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:56,000
So if everything goes away, we're safe.

250
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,000
And Moomin needs to be made normal.

251
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Don't fall asleep, Moomin troll. Please, we need to find the mushrooms.

252
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Dad, don't shake the cart.

253
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:18,000
We mustn't waste time. Are we still on the right track?

254
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Yeah, I don't grow those mushrooms on them.

255
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Oh, impossible.

256
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Oh, there are too many.

257
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:40,000
This is what I was afraid of. Jump down and come collect.

258
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
It's a big job.

259
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:46,000
But it has to be done, Moomin troll. Pull yourself together.

260
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Then you can rest as long as you want.

261
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Oh, oh.

262
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:00,000
Oh, all the mushrooms picked.

263
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:06,000
Let's take the mushrooms home and burn them.

264
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Moomin goblin, let's go home.

265
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Oh, father, don't leave me here.

266
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Just like a carousel.

267
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:51,000
I enjoy this much more.

268
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
Hen too.

269
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
Moomin troll.

270
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Hey.

271
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,000
What do you have in mind?

272
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:31,000
Should we go to the beach? Starting to feel wet.

273
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:34,000
Wait, I'll save you.

274
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
Muhumi get ashore.

275
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
Don't learn.

276
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:02,000
One hundred and one thousand

277
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
Knockout and mushrooms.

278
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:12,000
Yeah, everyone else fell asleep except dad, who wears a nose mask because of the hay fever.

279
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,000
You need to be delivered home.

280
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:18,000
The mushrooms must be burned first.

281
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:22,000
It's not necessary. Mushrooms drift into the sea.

282
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
Take my support!

283
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:29,000
The Moomin troll will definitely come to help, get up.

284
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
The journey home took a long time.

285
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
A week had passed.

286
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,000
No, I want too.

287
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,000
It doesn't work, the balance is upset!

288
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,000
Hmph!

289
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,000
Au!

290
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,000
Look, now how did it go?

291
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
We like to pretend.

292
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
Understand it.

293
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
Mummy Moomin!

294
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
Just come here!

295
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
Go sit on it!

296
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
Oops, this could be fun.

297
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,000
Come on.

298
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,000
Ui!

299
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,000
Au!

300
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:19,000
Everyone had now recovered from the silence caused by the member.

301
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:24,000
But Moominpappa was so stressed that he dived under the covers.

302
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:27,000
That some people can handle it.

303
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
Nights!
