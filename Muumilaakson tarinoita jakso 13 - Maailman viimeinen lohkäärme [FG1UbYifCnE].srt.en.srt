1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:14,000
It was raining heavily in Muunilaak, as if someone had pulled a plug from the sky and made it disappear.

2
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
It was very, very wet indeed.

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
It was very, very wet indeed.

4
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Mom, can I borrow this?

5
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Of course.

6
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Can I borrow this too?

7
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
You can, but what do you need them for?

8
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Secret.

9
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Or a secret.

10
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,000
You can keep the can, but I want the strainer back.

11
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:40,000
It was raining heavily in Muunilaak, as if someone had pulled a plug from the sky and made it disappear.

12
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,000
The heavy rain has made the ground wet.

13
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Oh, I'm a hemuliparka.

14
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Hemuli!

15
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Good morning, Moomin.

16
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
The water is cloudy.

17
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
What are you up to?

18
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
I make important observations.

19
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Great.

20
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:13,000
It's funny that botany interests you too. What are you going to research?

21
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
I'm sure I saw a handsome crab.

22
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Young man, it belongs to zoology, which is a rather uninteresting field.

23
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
There it is.

24
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
I got it.

25
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
I got it.

26
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
I got it.

27
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
I got it.

28
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
I got it.

29
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Good morning!

30
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
I got it, I got it.

31
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Oh, Junkku.

32
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Father!

33
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
What now?

34
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Nothing.

35
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Everything feels so fresh after the rain.

36
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
So.

37
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Go show the snuff to the muikku. No one can see this before him.

38
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Wake up.

39
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Ha!

40
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
What's up with you?

41
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Nothing. Nothing at all.

42
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
No need to pilot. I saw.

43
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Just an empty jam jar given by my mother.

44
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
There's something in that.

45
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
I say it isn't.

46
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Then why are you piloting?

47
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:03,000
The cat will take it. Why did I have to come across the little sale?

48
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Salmon finger. I was right.

49
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
It must be a baby salmon roe.

50
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,000
It has come with the rain and it is the last salmon head on Earth.

51
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
How fun.

52
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
I hope I didn't scare you.

53
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Let's open the lid to get some air.

54
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Well, is it better now?

55
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Moomin's little poplar tree.

56
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
What?

57
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Hear it burned.

58
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
You're a raging little salmon snake.

59
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
I will take you into my care.

60
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
You sleep on my pillow at night.

61
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Help. Of course you are very hungry.

62
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Wait. I'll get you something from my nightstand first.

63
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
I'll take you from the nightstand.

64
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
I'll take you from the nightstand.

65
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Choose. Raisin cake is good.

66
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Oh...

67
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,000
My little mutu mutu.

68
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Granny goblin, to eat.

69
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Joo.

70
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Wait here. I'll be right back.

71
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Don't worry, little crumb.

72
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
A small crumb.

73
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:18,680
Isn't Nipsu here?

74
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:21,160
He is collecting fishing worms.

75
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:22,400
He will come right away.

76
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:24,520
Shall we start?

77
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:27,600
Some keep secrets in glass jars.

78
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:30,480
In a glass jar?

79
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:34,720
Oh! Secrets that sizzle.

80
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:38,720
Moomin, I found this by the puddle.

81
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:41,720
My favorite Siivilä.

82
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:45,720
Moomin, you promised to return Siivilä.

83
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:51,720
Sorry mom, I got so excited, I mean I forgot.

84
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:54,720
It's clear who that someone is?

85
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:57,720
Did you catch something in Siivila?

86
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:01,720
He got something that he has hidden in the room.

87
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:03,720
Goof off.

88
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:06,720
If it's a secret, he might not want to talk about it.

89
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:09,720
Yes, when his pet bites.

90
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:11,720
Have you been bitten?

91
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:13,720
I would bite back.

92
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:16,720
Will it bite your secret?

93
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:21,720
The one that fits in the jam jar is so small that you can't take a bite.

94
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:26,720
Some keep poisonous scorpions or earthworms in a glass jar.

95
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:34,720
They are very small or inspiring and resourceful centipedes that multiply and multiply every week.

96
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:41,720
And then those expectations eat, encourage us all in the mouth.

97
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:46,720
I don't have centipedes.

98
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:49,720
There can be such things in outer space.

99
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:52,720
Honey, we live on earth.

100
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:55,720
But they could have fallen to the ground with the rain.

101
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:58,720
It really rained hard yesterday.

102
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:01,720
And it was no ordinary rain.

103
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:06,720
No, there's a lake-sized puddle outside.

104
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:08,720
What now?

105
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:10,720
It's not a centipede.

106
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:14,720
I think we are on the right track.

107
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:19,720
Glad it's not a poisonous centipede.

108
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:24,720
Moomin's little cult

109
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:29,720
Oh, you're sleeping.

110
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:32,720
Moomin's little cult.

111
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:38,720
I'm going to meet the snus muikku.

112
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:40,720
did you eat

113
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:46,720
Yes mom, tell no one to enter my room or I will not be responsible for the consequences.

114
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:50,720
Not a single living soul can open the door to your room.

115
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:55,720
He goes to tell the snuffer.

116
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:58,720
I hope we find out too.

117
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:01,720
Good friends always first.

118
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:18,720
Hello, little snuff.

119
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:20,720
Hey.

120
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,720
Going fishing again?

121
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:27,720
The cards said that somewhere to catch five roaches, I'm going south.

122
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:30,720
Oh, to the south, don't be silly.

123
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:33,720
You know I'm superstitious.

124
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:36,720
But winter won't come for a long time.

125
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:40,720
I know, I know, but the cards told.

126
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:42,720
That would be horrible.

127
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:46,720
I would be terribly lonely if you left.

128
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:50,720
Who would I talk to, who would I tell secrets to?

129
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:57,720
Oh yeah, I have something to show you.

130
00:10:58,720 --> 00:10:59,720
Now?

131
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:00,720
So.

132
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:02,720
I can fish later.

133
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:04,720
Fishing is stupid.

134
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:06,720
But I have to get five roaches.

135
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:12,720
It won't work, it's been raining so hard lately that the fish won't eat anyway.

136
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:14,720
Maybe you're right.

137
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:16,720
So what's the secret?

138
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:21,720
Have you ever seen a salmon roe?

139
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:23,720
Of course not.

140
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:27,720
Salmon snakes already disappeared hundreds of years ago.

141
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:32,720
What if there was one more salmon snake alive somewhere?

142
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:34,720
Out.

143
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:37,720
So small you could put it in a glass jar.

144
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:40,720
Looks like a napping mummy, Pikko.

145
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:42,720
I won't believe until I see.

146
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:46,720
But if I see, I believe, no matter how pointless it was.

147
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:53,720
Where is it?

148
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:57,720
Mom wasn't supposed to let anyone in my room.

149
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:03,720
Not here either.

150
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:06,720
Holy shit, you were right.

151
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:13,720
There it is.

152
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:15,720
Real salmon fillet.

153
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:17,720
How did it get up there?

154
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:19,720
It must not fall.

155
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:20,720
Be very quiet.

156
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:21,720
Wait.

157
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:23,720
Don't, don't, don't say anything.

158
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:25,720
The tail can be broken if it falls.

159
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:28,720
Little one, don't be afraid.

160
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:31,720
Come now.

161
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:33,720
Fall down the ghost will trap you down.

162
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:34,720
Very carefully.

163
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:37,720
Just, just, just calmly.

164
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:40,720
That's not a good way.

165
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:41,720
You scare it.

166
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,720
Let's leave it alone.

167
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:47,720
It comes down when it wants to.

168
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:49,720
Salmon snakes are not helpless.

169
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:52,720
But it's so tiny.

170
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:55,720
Come on, granny.

171
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:56,720
Come, come, come.

172
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:58,720
Don't, don't, don't.

173
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:00,720
Don't, don't, don't.

174
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:12,720
Look at my salmon snake fly.

175
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:14,720
It can fly.

176
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:15,720
I did see it.

177
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:17,720
Come down to my salmon skinned beauty.

178
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:19,720
You won't fly into any gap.

179
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:22,720
Don't, don't, don't, don't.

180
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:24,720
Don't, don't, don't.

181
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:30,720
Snuff Muikkunen it Bite me.

182
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:46,720
An amusing creature. What is it going to do now?

183
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:50,720
It seems to like you.

184
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:55,720
Oh.

185
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:00,720
A very unusual home life.

186
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:03,720
What piece of cake? What is its name?

187
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:05,720
It doesn't have a name.

188
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:07,720
Not even a bite to begin with.

189
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:09,720
Small but wild.

190
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:11,720
Just like you.

191
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:13,720
Do you think so?

192
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:15,720
No.

193
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:17,720
Oh.

194
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:19,720
Oh.

195
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:21,720
Oh.

196
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:23,720
Stop.

197
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:30,720
It seems to fall on deaf ears.

198
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:33,720
It doesn't bother Snuska Muikkunen's ears.

199
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:37,720
Why doesn't it bite the snuff?

200
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:39,720
Goodness.

201
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:43,720
I think it's trying to heat up Snuff Muikkunen's coffee.

202
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:48,720
It's bigger.

203
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:52,720
Whoa. What a perfect lighter for pleasure trips.

204
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:54,720
Well, that's enough.

205
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:57,720
Is it just big?

206
00:14:57,720 --> 00:15:01,720
We can keep it in the basement instead of the heating boiler.

207
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:04,720
It's out of the question.

208
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:13,720
You damn.

209
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:21,720
Terrible lizard too.

210
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:23,720
It thought you were trying to take that fly.

211
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:27,720
If it bites me one more time, I will show it.

212
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:29,720
Come to the goblin.

213
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:33,720
Oh.

214
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:45,720
Thanks for the coffee.

215
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:48,720
Let's continue my journey from here.

216
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:03,720
It suffocates in that area.

217
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:18,720
It just likes sniffing.

218
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:21,720
After all, we all like snuff.

219
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:23,720
Stupid salmon roe.

220
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:25,720
And it isn't.

221
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:31,720
Moomin, I'll be so kind as to take the salmon snake to your room.

222
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:37,720
Neither do I. That's better.

223
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:41,720
Oh dear. Will it come?

224
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:45,720
Will it ever come back?

225
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:49,720
We could have kept ear muffs.

226
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:53,720
You can go and say hello to that snuff muikku's tent.

227
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:56,720
It's sitting on the shoulder of a snuff snot.

228
00:16:56,720 --> 00:17:01,720
Nuuska Muikkunen is leaving for the south soon, so let me go with him.

229
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:04,720
My troll gold.

230
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:07,720
The worst place.

231
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:09,720
Fall back to the Moomin.

232
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:12,720
House, mene pois. House!

233
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:16,720
Don't do that. Back to Moomin.

234
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:21,720
You're nice and it would be fun to keep you company.

235
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:24,720
But think of Moomin.

236
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:27,720
Oh, another one.

237
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:31,720
The fifth roach. It even is.

238
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:40,720
Now what?

239
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:43,720
That's what he brings. Going far?

240
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:45,720
Well, for a while.

241
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:47,720
You will get a unit.

242
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:49,720
Let's go.

243
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:51,720
Let's go.

244
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:53,720
Let's go.

245
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:55,720
Are you far away?

246
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:57,720
Well, for a while.

247
00:17:57,720 --> 00:17:59,720
You will definitely get hungry.

248
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:01,720
Do you catch fish?

249
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:06,720
What do you want in return?

250
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:08,720
A small favor.

251
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:19,720
Carry this pitcher as far as you can.

252
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:21,720
And then I leave it?

253
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:25,720
So. Somewhere nice where there are a lot of flies.

254
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:27,720
Oh flies?

255
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:28,720
So.

256
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:30,720
So what's in this jug?

257
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:32,720
Salmon finger.

258
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:35,720
Even something. Does it bite?

259
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:38,720
It is possible. Keep the lid closed.

260
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:41,720
But open it then the salmon snake can catch flies.

261
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:45,720
You are asking for a great service. And I don't even like roaches.

262
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:47,720
They are delicious when fried.

263
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:53,720
Hey.

264
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:55,720
Hey.

265
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:58,720
Where is it?

266
00:18:58,720 --> 00:18:59,720
What is it?

267
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:01,720
Salmon finger.

268
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:02,720
I guess it came here?

269
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:05,720
No. I thought it was in your room sleeping.

270
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:09,720
No. I let it out the window.

271
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:13,720
Oh well. The salmon roe are stunning.

272
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:16,720
They don't really care about anything else as long as they get it.

273
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:18,720
Did you get five roaches?

274
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:21,720
I don't. You were right. The fish won't eat.

275
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:22,720
Right?

276
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:24,720
So I don't think I'll even go south.

277
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:26,720
So you're staying here?

278
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:31,720
Ice. I'm superstitious. I dare not oppose the cards.

279
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:36,720
Oh. It's good there. Oh, what fun. Top. Lovely.

280
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:38,720
Hey.

281
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:40,720
Hey.

282
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:42,720
Hey.

283
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:44,720
Hey.

284
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:46,720
Top. Lovely.

285
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:52,720
Maybe I shouldn't have painted the ridge red.

286
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:55,720
It can spook the fish. Shall we go back?

287
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:57,720
Joo.

288
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:01,720
The salmon finger was really stupid.

289
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:07,720
Salmon snakes are stupid. They are probably the worst domestic animals that exist.

290
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:09,720
True.

291
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:15,720
I just thought it was an amusing case when a salmon snake would bite a small mullet.

292
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:22,720
Moomin was very happy that Nuuska Muikkunen still stayed in Moomin Valley.

293
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:27,720
And who cares about a fool's affection for salmon snakes.
