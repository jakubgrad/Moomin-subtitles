1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Moomin Valley is once again a true haven of peace.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:12,000
On a perfect day, police chief Mymmel and little Mymymiele go on a fun trip.

3
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Police, why don't you ever arrest anyone?

4
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
That what?

5
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
You're just buzzing around your sister like a bee.

6
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Oh, not that. Yesterday too I spent the whole day tending roses in my garden.

7
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Oh, that was on Monday. The pleasure trip has continued for three days.

8
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Time flies with your sister.

9
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Roses and pleasure trips are not part of the official duties of the police.

10
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
What do you think the police would consider a video?

11
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Well, to examine fingerprints and chase bandits, of course.

12
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
But when there are no criminals in Moomin Valley.

13
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
And I guess not if they are.

14
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Who would break the law here?

15
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
No one is boring.

16
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Maybe from some corner, but not too busy with work.

17
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Well, no.

18
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
I can crack up to my heart's desire at any time.

19
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
The salary comes from nothing.

20
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Hi Myy, I have a request for you.

21
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Oh, what request?

22
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
You're disturbing. Grab some snacks and go somewhere else.

23
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Lovely scent.

24
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Soman Eito, I'm handing you a bouquet that pales in comparison to your beauty.

25
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Joy belongs and corresponds to the truth of rare flowers.

26
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Not familiar with white lilies?

27
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
They grow everywhere.

28
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
You again?

29
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Are you rehearsing for a play?

30
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
We don't. Leave us alone.

31
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Young lovers talk like this.

32
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
You're ruining the mood.

33
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
It's confusing.

34
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
I've come up with a brilliant spread.

35
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
What?

36
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Let's start dating.

37
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Oh!

38
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
I want you to be my sweetheart.

39
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Spring is in the air without a doubt.

40
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Moomin Valley Police.

41
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Good day, Police Commander.

42
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Was just on an inspection trip.

43
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
No, no, perfectly calm.

44
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:01,000
I am happy to report that the crimes have completely stopped.

45
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000
It's quite loco in Moomin Valley.

46
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Right?

47
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
What?

48
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Yes, but when...

49
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Oh, this came out of the blue.

50
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Sad.

51
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Or so?

52
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Or it's already decided.

53
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Yes, but what about me?

54
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Hello, police.

55
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Beautiful day today.

56
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Hmm.

57
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Hey kids, where are you going?

58
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Hello, Moomin.

59
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Well, day.

60
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Is Moominpa at home?

61
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Of course, have there been any crimes?

62
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
No, unfortunately not a single one.

63
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Hmm.

64
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Oh weird, that's horrible.

65
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
That's right, I'm desperate.

66
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Moomin Valley won't be the same without you.

67
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
When does the police station close?

68
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
According to my information, very soon.

69
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,000
As deserving as you are.

70
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
That's it.

71
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
I have been very competent.

72
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,000
No more crimes are committed in Moomin Valley.

73
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Hmm.

74
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
That's what it smelled like.

75
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Stink alone is not enough.

76
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:53,000
You realize I'm getting fired from my police job, right?

77
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Oh my god.

78
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:01,000
You also don't happen to have anything on your face that I could arrest you for.

79
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
I have gone to this man.

80
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
A police officer.

81
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
We need to help the police.

82
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
He is so nice.

83
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
We could write a petition on behalf of the police.

84
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,000
But the matter has already been decided by a higher authority.

85
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
So.

86
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:23,000
And there's no need for a police station here in Moomin Valley.

87
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,000
The chief of police needs to find another job.

88
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,000
But he is comfortable in his current position.

89
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
That will sell.

90
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Uh, I'm pitching a tent.

91
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Daredevil!

92
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
You must help my sister.

93
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
What has happened to him?

94
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Nothing really, but he is hopelessly in love with uniforms.

95
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
So what then?

96
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:58,000
I shudder when I think about how things go when the police get fired.

97
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Your sister is eccentric.

98
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:06,000
I am convinced that the police will be allowed to wear their old uniform.

99
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Yeah, yeah, but it's not the same.

100
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,000
It would then be like a fancy dress.

101
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Is there nothing you can do about this?

102
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Did you come up with a solution?

103
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:22,000
If crimes were committed here, the police station could not be abolished.

104
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,000
But when we are so law-abiding here.

105
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
If someone falls into a crime.

106
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Do we?

107
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Let's make Moomin Valley a nest of crimes.

108
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Remarkable.

109
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Where did I put it?

110
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Mom, mom!

111
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
What's the matter?

112
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Have you seen my hat?

113
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Well share, yes. I saw it in you yesterday.

114
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:51,000
I put the top hat on this morning too.

115
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Jeez, when did you waste it?

116
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:57,000
I just woke up from a nap.

117
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,000
You left your hat somewhere.

118
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,000
I never leave it anywhere.

119
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Hello, have you seen my handbag?

120
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Me?

121
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,000
As I recall, I saw it on you yesterday.

122
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Yes, but in the morning, as usual, I went downstairs with a bag in my arm.

123
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Where did you see it last?

124
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,000
In the kitchen, pantry or dining room.

125
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Oh holy sylph.

126
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Mother, mother!

127
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
What, honey?

128
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Have you seen my knife?

129
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
I'm not.

130
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:39,000
I'm sure I left it on the desk.

131
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:43,000
You haven't seen my handbag have you?

132
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
What's going on here?

133
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:52,000
I'm looking for my top hat, it should be around here somewhere.

134
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Just don't say it's lost either.

135
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:59,000
That's it, but in the morning I still had the hat on.

136
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Hand this.

137
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
What do you mean?

138
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
My hook is missing too.

139
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:08,000
In the morning I was fishing, but then the fishing rod suddenly got in the way.

140
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Johan is a freak.

141
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Top hat, handbag.

142
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Stolen.

143
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
What?

144
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,000
There is a thief on the move in Moominvalley.

145
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,000
I realized that you are missing more things.

146
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,000
So missing.

147
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Mammoth, mammoth!

148
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Have you found your handbag?

149
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
I don't. What about your hats?

150
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
In.

151
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,000
And don't forget my knife, Dad.

152
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Nuuska Muikkunen is right.

153
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
What did dad mean?

154
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
My luck is gone.

155
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Now steal my hat.

156
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
And my handbag.

157
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Devilish.

158
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
And a knife.

159
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Healthy muuta.

160
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Who might be interested in my Handbag?

161
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,000
There's nothing valuable inside.

162
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Now comes the end.

163
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
What's wrong, Nipsu?

164
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Someone has stolen a gold coin from me.

165
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Oh, from you too.

166
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,000
What? Has anyone else lost their gold coins?

167
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,000
No coins, but a handbag and a hat.

168
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
I will stab Muikkunen's problem.

169
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Oh all our treasures.

170
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Who is to blame?

171
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
The thief must be caught.

172
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,000
It's not our job, it's the police's.

173
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Properly. Let's go to the police station.

174
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Absolutely.

175
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Valuables have been stolen.

176
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Everything is done to find the criminal.

177
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
The arrest will happen soon.

178
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Thank you, thank you. Goodbye.

179
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Well, well. What's wrong now?

180
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Looks like we've been hacked.

181
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
It seems so.

182
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
And not just looks.

183
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,000
We have a cold-blooded, hardened criminal.

184
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
A coin was taken from me.

185
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
What has been stolen from the store?

186
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,000
A string of pearls is made from chocolate and mymmels.

187
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Nope.

188
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,000
I gave it to him. It was an expensive gift.

189
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
I want chocolate with them.

190
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:24,000
I warn you that in these cases the chocolate is almost always lit before the rosmus is closed.

191
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
What is missing from Niskunen?

192
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
A wonderful treasure box.

193
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
All of them with their contents or?

194
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Are they more visible, and the shoes are missing?

195
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,000
A thief is not good for anything.

196
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
But don't be sad.

197
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,000
I'll catch the thief, any way I can.

198
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Are you sure?

199
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Of course.

200
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Sell, tell the insiders that I'll come to comfort him as soon as I recover from my haste.

201
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:54,000
So the police began to investigate their latest case.

202
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Ah, yes.

203
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:01,000
On this table, are you putting these in your handbag for the last time?

204
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Exactly.

205
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Are you sure you left the knife on the desk?

206
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Joo.

207
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,000
And you don't have any leads?
