00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Next week

2
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Hi! Where is Ninni?

3
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Ninni said she wants to play with us.

4
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Nini! Come and have fun!

5
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Now let's go and...

6
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Ninni, who had become invisible because of her ironic aunt, was now visible up to her neck,

7
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:04,000
but the head refused to appear, even though Mamma Moomin poured grandmother's medicine into it.

8
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,000
See what the invisible child looks like!

9
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Good morning everyone!

10
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,000
You too, Fatfish! It's past twelve o'clock!

11
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Let's play hide and seek in the forest.

12
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Great! How are you, Ninni?

13
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Very.

14
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Um, stupid. If I could see you, I wouldn't have to ask.

15
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
As for you, you always act like a fool!

16
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Hey...

17
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
This place is great for playing hide and seek.

18
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
The bigger the more exciting.

19
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
However, let's adopt a new rule...

20
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
What?

21
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,000
That you can't change your hiding place in the middle of everything.

22
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Did you understand, Ninni?

23
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Nipsu, you will be the first.

24
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Why always me?

25
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
We have to practice because Ninni is with us.

26
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
No need to practice hiding.

27
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
You see, Ninni has never played hide and seek.

28
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Oh, right?

29
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Ninni has never played hide and seek or anything else.

30
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Even when it looked like it, huh?

31
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Oh, anyway.

32
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Is it okay for you to stay?

33
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
I won't stay.

34
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
All right, I'll stay.

35
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:03,000
I'll slowly count to ten so you can hide.

36
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
One...

37
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Two...

38
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Hurry up and hide, Ninni.

39
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Three...

40
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Four...

41
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Go further.

42
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Five...

43
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Six...

44
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Seven...

45
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Eight...

46
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Nine...

47
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
No, Ninni.

48
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Don't be afraid of me.

49
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Go hide behind that bush.

50
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
I started looking.

51
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Thanks.

52
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Thanks.

53
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Au, au, au!

54
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
I found you in a pinch.

55
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
No, no, no, no!

56
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Wake up!

57
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
The sale has been found.

58
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Where is Ninni hiding?

59
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Wake up!

60
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
I found you.

61
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,000
You had a good hiding place, but it got you.

62
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Your bow showed.

63
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:37,000
No longer a swamp lady, but she's never hard to find.

64
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Niiskunneiti wants him to be found.

65
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Niiskunnetti was found.

66
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Three...

67
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Four...

68
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Five...

69
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
This is my gasoline.

70
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Six...

71
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Seven...

72
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
No, Ninni.

73
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
I'll give you a good hiding.

74
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
You will never be found there.

75
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:19,000
The mouth here is a bit tight, but inside the corridor is wide.

76
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Hurry, or Nipsu will find you.

77
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:51,000
That's how, when you stay there until tomorrow, you become completely invisible.

78
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
I want out.

79
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Tomorrow we're going to rob a bank together.

80
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
I didn't want to.

81
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
That's it from me.

82
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,000
You're half... a quarter of the booty.

83
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
So.

84
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Good thing I figured out how to bring Ninn here.

85
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,000
It's funny that you think so, Tuutikki.

86
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:41,000
You are so special that your strange behavior can make Ninn visible again.

87
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,000
And of course you are kind.

88
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Please share. We should be flattered.

89
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Necessarily.

90
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:54,000
By the way, Ninni is already talking. His voice is really good.

91
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Has her voice always been like that?

92
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Who knows, even if it is.

93
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Otherwise, many people get along just fine without using their heads.

94
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:12,000
It's fun when Ninn has playmates. He's never had them before.

95
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,000
But I don't think he knows how to play.

96
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:19,000
I think some sort of shock would be necessary for him.

97
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
I found you!

98
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Phew, there were spikes in the gasoline.

99
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
I was the last to be found.

100
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Ninni is not found.

101
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Movement.

102
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:34,000
You hid in the same gas station as Ninni.

103
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Ninni is clever.

104
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Come on, maybe Ninni is lost.

105
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:46,000
I have searched everywhere but he has become invisible again and therefore I cannot find him.

106
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Nipsu is in bad trouble.

107
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Where could Ninni be anyway?

108
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:56,000
I don't know, I haven't seen it.

109
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Ninni, come out, we're going home.

110
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Which one is he in?

111
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
It's your job to find him.

112
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Not anymore when we're done playing.

113
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Yes, I think we need to find Ninni.

114
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Let's all go find it.

115
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Hi Ninni, come out, the games are over.

116
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Ninni, we're going home to drink juice and eat cookies.

117
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Nini! Nini!

118
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,000
where are you Nini!

119
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:49,000
We shouldn't have gone this far into hiding.

120
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Listen, if Ninni is really lost.

121
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Nini! Nini!

122
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Come forth!

123
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Ninni, help me, I'm here!

124
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Did you hear?

125
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Did you hear something?

126
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Perhaps.

127
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
I'm here!

128
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Ninni's voice.

129
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
It sounds close.

130
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Ninni, where are you?

131
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Here, the expensive one is inside.

132
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Ninni, can't be far.

133
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Let's hurry.

134
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Ninni, I didn't understand what you said.

135
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,000
where are you

136
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,000
I'm here, here.

137
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Burn, burn.

138
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Say louder.

139
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Kalli is inside.

140
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Say it one more time.

141
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Here, the expensive one is inside.

142
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
There.

143
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Hey, I've never screamed so loud in my life.

144
00:10:55,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Ninni, are you trapped behind this rock?

145
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,000
I'm Stinky closed the door to the opening.

146
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:07,000
We'll get you out. Let's move on to reason.

147
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Are you OK?

148
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,000
I'm Moomin the goblin. Thanks.

149
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Your voice has become stronger.

150
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Recovered?

151
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Or so.

152
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Grab my hand and I'll pull you out.

153
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
I will come.

154
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Ahoy! What has happened?

155
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Ninni was in the cave.

156
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Oh, great. Ninni found a great hiding place.

157
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Did I say something funny?

158
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:56,000
It's clever to think of Ninni robbing a bank.

159
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
I guess so.

160
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:02,000
The stench was quite a shock for Ninn.

161
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:06,000
But not only he became invisible.

162
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,000
And his voice is much louder now too.

163
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Ninni screamed as loud as she could.

164
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Did you scream really loud?

165
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
I screamed.

166
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Moomin told me to scream so he would know where I was.

167
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
And you screamed loud too.

168
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Dear Nini.

169
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Those who speak loudly are usually also visible.

170
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Remember that.

171
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Scream, I want to see you.

172
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Good idea. And try to get angry too.

173
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Tuutikki would be happy if you started showing up again.

174
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Get mad at Haisul.

175
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
The stench is so awful.

176
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,000
It shouldn't be. Let me be careful.

177
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Stink wait.

178
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
You can't catch me.

179
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Stink, I have something to do.

180
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,000
I have nothing to do with you.

181
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Did it hurt you?

182
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Stink, you can't run away.

183
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:17,000
The forest is my home field. You can't catch me like this.

184
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
ha Isu Li.

185
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
You can't do this to me.

186
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,000
We will do to you what you did to Ninn.

187
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,000
I needed Ninn's help.

188
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
He didn't want to help.

189
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:47,000
I brought him here to change his mind.

190
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:51,000
And would be so shocked that it would become completely invisible.

191
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
The skunk insists that he is invisible.

192
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Let me out.

193
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Shouldn't be heard. Tomorrow.

194
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:07,000
You scoundrels are doing this out of sheer malice.

195
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
This will be remembered.

196
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Despite everything, Ninn's face was still invisible.

197
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Then ten days later.

198
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:38,000
The nails are sticking out in this weather.

199
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:42,000
I've never seen anyone stare into the sea like that.

200
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,000
I guess Ninni has never seen the sea before.

201
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Well, now he's coming.

202
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Nini, what's wrong?

203
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:09,000
The sea is too big. Way too big.

204
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
I don't need you.

205
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Mummy mom hello.

206
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
So?

207
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
What's wrong with Nin?

208
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
There's nothing wrong with living.

209
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:25,000
He is amazed by the size of the sea.

210
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Yeah, there's an awful lot of water in the sea.

211
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Haa.

212
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:40,000
For my part, I haven't been surprised or excited for weeks.

213
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Mom is bored.

214
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Probably.

215
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Mother never is.

216
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Now he clearly is.

217
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:51,000
He hopes something surprising will happen.

218
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
Mom is bored.

219
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
Mom is bored.

220
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Mom is bored.

221
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Mom is bored.

222
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:03,000
He hopes something surprising will happen.

223
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Do you think?

224
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
We have to arrange a surprise for mom.

225
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
What kind?

226
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,000
So that he is really surprised.

227
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Dad, don't just say you're going to dump mom in the ocean.

228
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
What could be a better surprise?

229
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:21,000
But the water is terribly cold.

230
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Hey, when we were young, the water was never too cold for us.

231
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Did you push each other into the sea?

232
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
All the time.

233
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Father.

234
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
So what?

235
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
Nothing.

236
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Don't worry.

237
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:38,000
It's going to be a lot of fun for mom.

238
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
Must not!

239
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:12,000
Dare Lappas push Moominmamma into the sea?

240
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Let me explain.

241
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,000
There is no explaining the mischief.

242
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,000
Moomin would get drenched.

243
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
You can't do that!

244
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
bother?

245
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
The nipple is visible!

246
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
How fun?

247
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:42,000
Finally we see Nenn.

248
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:46,000
Dad, did something happen?

249
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Well, not really.

250
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
He has amazed.

251
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
He has amazed.

252
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
He has amazed.

253
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Dad, did something happen?

254
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Well, not really.

255
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:02,000
He's the meanest and sharpest kid I've ever seen.

256
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,000
I finally became visible.

257
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
Yes, and you won't disappear anymore.

258
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
I will never.

259
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:13,000
A playful girl and obviously with good teeth.

260
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
Nenni, be so happy.

261
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
Don't bother.

262
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
Mamma.

263
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
I'm happy too.

264
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
Oh.

265
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:49,000
Don't laugh you evil brat, you toothy monster.

266
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
What's so funny?

267
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:19,000
Did Nenni really laugh?

268
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:22,000
You have truly changed him.

269
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:25,000
Yeah, he's almost as bad as the little one.

270
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:28,000
I've never heard Ninn laugh.

271
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:34,000
But the best thing is that he has become visible again.

272
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
Tuttik!

273
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:46,000
And so the tuttik took Ninn, as he had brought.

274
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:50,000
But now Ninnin was visible and was anything but timid.

275
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:55,000
Ninnin was reportedly ready for anything except going to her aunt's house.

276
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
Thank you.
