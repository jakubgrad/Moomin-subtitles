1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
A box with seeds had washed ashore.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
A tropical forest grew from them.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Some seeds sprouted carnivores and plants.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Only the music kept them going, but no one can play forever.

5
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Snuff, don't stop calling.

6
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Gluttony and plants attack us again.

7
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
My desire to play is about to take forever.

8
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Maybe they have already been tamed by the sound of Snuff.

9
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Hemuli be careful.

10
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I have my own weeks.

11
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Hemuli, you're looking behind!

12
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
What?

13
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I warned you!

14
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Snuff plants aren't tame yet!

15
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
What?

16
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
What?

17
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,000
I still have tame ice!

18
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,000
You have to put something heavy on top of the floor lock.

19
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Absolutely.

20
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
What do you do on meat night?

21
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
I still have tame ice.

22
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
I still have tames.

23
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
I still have tames.

24
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
I still have tames.

25
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I still have tames.

26
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
I still have tames.

27
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
What do you do with muscle plants?

28
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:00,000
The snuffbox tries to attract them to the basement with a beautiful song.

29
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Aha! There they come!

30
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
I mean, something else.

31
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:29,000
If we leave carnivorous plants out, they can eat us alive.

32
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
It's night.

33
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
In my opinion, it must be very hard.

34
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
I still have tames.

35
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
I still have tames.

36
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
I still have tames.

37
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
I still have tames.

38
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
I still have tames.

39
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:56,000
The thought of carnivorous plants crawling on the floor below bothers me.

40
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Mamma, always have a kettle of boiling water handy.

41
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Children play tarzan in the jungle.

42
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Glad they've come up with something to do.

43
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Sowing the seeds may have been a mistake.

44
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:16,000
I am happy. Moomin Valley bursts with tropical plants.

45
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
I don't like traveling.

46
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,000
It is much better that the plants have come to me.

47
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
All I can do is thank you.

48
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Of course, trees beautify the landscape.

49
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
But carnivorous plants are disgusting.

50
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
You are just like Tartsan.

51
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Tartsan loves Jane.

52
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Oh, what bliss.

53
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
There's Stink over there.

54
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Or Stink? Tartsan gives a lesson to the mischievous.

55
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Oh, oh, oh.

56
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:13,000
This is a stupid game of tarzan without wild animals.

57
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Animals do not grow from seeds.

58
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Not like that, but I can get you some animals if you want.

59
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Really?

60
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Nothing is too much for those who block.

61
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Well thought out, but don't get animals that are too wild.

62
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
A chimpanzee could fit.

63
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Know exactly what you need.

64
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Then the breads.

65
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
what are you doing

66
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:50,000
I'm still uncomfortable with carnivorous plants.

67
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Pappa and I used to sleep in the bathroom.

68
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:57,000
I sleep outside, in the hut we built.

69
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
What if you don't know how to sell them?

70
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Well, they also come to the lodge alone.

71
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Only Hemuli stays in the house in that case.

72
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,000
He says he still wants to look at the plants.

73
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Mamma, is everything ready?

74
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Yes, papa.

75
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Are you leaving?

76
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Yeah, see you later.

77
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Not only.

78
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,000
The skunk promised to get wild animals in our jungle.

79
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Whence?

80
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
I don't know.

81
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Be careful that Haisuli hasn't put a hedgehog in your sleeping bag.

82
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
This is where our lodge is.

83
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Very well built.

84
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Look, it's an amazing place.

85
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
A real jungle.

86
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
We don't want a park anywhere.

87
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,000
No, no, it's a jungle.

88
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
About.

89
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Oh.

90
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Oh.

91
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Oh.

92
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Oh.

93
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Oh.

94
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Oh.

95
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,000
It feels like new to run free.

96
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,000
It's wonderful to rush to Moominvalley.

97
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:15,000
I certainly have the largest collection of rare plants in the yard.

98
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,000
It will become famous.

99
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,000
New plants are popping up all the time.

100
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,000
I'm not a zoologist.

101
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:43,000
See the chimpanzees that Haisuli promised us.

102
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:47,000
I'm smitten. I wouldn't have believed about Haisuli.

103
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
How sweet.

104
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Now I feel like I'm stuck.

105
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
What was it?

106
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
So.

107
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Oh.

108
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:11,000
It sounds like Haisuli has caught real wild beasts.

109
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Pekka.

110
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Just like in our home back in the old days, although the jungle is not big.

111
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
The mind becomes sensitive.

112
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Moomins are going to prey here.

113
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Don't lick before you drop.

114
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Real tigers!

115
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Did you see something?

116
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Nothing like that. Don't be afraid. There are no wild beasts here.

117
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Right?

118
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Picture, Pekko!

119
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Homemade barley bread!

120
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Wild Tigers are coming to eat you.

121
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Don't now.

122
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Somehow protect the Moomin house.

123
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,000
No way. The tigers are almost here.

124
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
To the bathroom.

125
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Pekka.

126
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Shall we eat him to pieces?

127
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,000
We know that your stomach is upset with hemule.

128
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Where are the Moomins?

129
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,000
No, I don't study animals.

130
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Father!

131
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Dad help!

132
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
What do you have now?

133
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Two ferocious tigers are chasing us.

134
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
And you don't have fun?

135
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Maybe Haisoli has told us that we have good taste.

136
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
We certainly are.

137
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
The tigers are approaching.

138
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
I have an idea.

139
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Moomin Pekko goes to get a really big stone.

140
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
This work.

141
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Is this okay?

142
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
It's really good.

143
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Now go back to the bathroom.

144
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
That's where they come from.

145
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Are you really going to eat the Moomins?

146
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Necessarily.

147
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,000
I'm hungry. They would hide in the booth.

148
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,000
They are too quiet. I don't like this.

149
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Ha, they don't scare the hell out of you.

150
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Why is there a rock in there?

151
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Dad we made it.

152
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Of course, honey.

153
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
My husband is about to drown.

154
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Oh, how sad. Papa let's save him.

155
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,000
He was going to eat us in his mouth.

156
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Probably won't try again.

157
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
I have an idea.

158
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
I have an idea.

159
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
I have an idea.

160
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
I have an idea.

161
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
I have an idea.

162
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
I have an idea.

163
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
I have an idea.

164
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
I have an idea.

165
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
I have an idea.

166
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:28,400
A young one

167
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:32,960
From the moon

168
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:37,040
Now if only we could drive this to Laituuri

169
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:42,760
Tie a rope around him, and we'll pull him up

170
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:44,760
Good idea!

171
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:04,760
Hey, wake up!

172
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:07,760
Are you okay?

173
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:10,760
Did we Moomins eat?

174
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:12,760
It wasn't us Moomins who saved you.

175
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:19,760
The Moomins are in that booth behind your back if you still want to eat them.

176
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:23,760
My appetite has completely disappeared.

177
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:25,760
Well then jump over here.

178
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:27,760
All right, I'll defect.

179
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:36,760
What is yours?

180
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:40,760
I don't dare to jump, I've been in the zoo too long.

181
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:43,760
Well then try to swim across.

182
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:46,760
Clear.

183
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:59,760
The tigers are leaving.

184
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:03,760
It's funny that the tiger didn't drown.

185
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:09,760
I don't think the tigers ate us.

186
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:13,760
Shall we jump into the water and swim home?

187
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:16,760
Alright please, I'll be the first to jump.

188
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:18,760
I had to be the first!

189
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:20,760
Don't beg!

190
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:23,760
Be careful mummy, be careful look over there!

191
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:29,760
Oh, crocodiles!

192
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:32,760
Moomin, swim to the sly swimming ladder!

193
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:38,760
How can there be crocodiles in the sea?

194
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:42,760
Oh, my dear, you can't get out of here in the eternal world.

195
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:45,760
I have to wait for the ferry to pass.

196
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:48,760
It can take a week.

197
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:51,760
Ship traffic is not very busy.

198
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:57,760
Oh week, my nerves can't stand being around that long.

199
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:01,760
Oh week, my nerves can't stand being around that long.

200
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:07,760
Oh week, my nerves can't take being in the dock for so long.

201
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:10,760
Ships usually don't even call at our pier.

202
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:12,760
Good morning!

203
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:17,760
Snuff can be made to order.

204
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:24,760
I was thinking of fishing in salt water, but I changed my mind, I don't want a sea monster on my fishing line.

205
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:36,760
Come to the tree! Come to the tree!

206
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:40,760
Hemul's voice. Maybe the tigers are chasing him now.

207
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:54,760
What annoyed you so much? I just told you not to eat my plants.

208
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:03,760
Help!

209
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:14,760
The rhinoceros is a skunk.

210
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:16,760
Can we help?

211
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:17,760
Hardly.

212
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:25,760
Hemuli, is everything alright?

213
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:27,760
Well, it's gone. That's all.

214
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:33,760
Who's that there? What do you do with a Rhino that is stuck in its horn?

215
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:37,760
I guess I have to get rid of it, but remember to be careful.

216
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:38,760
Let's try.

217
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:51,760
Astartsan!

218
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:54,760
You brought the beasts here, didn't you? Recognize away.

219
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:58,760
I guess so. After all, he wanted a real jungle.

220
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:03,760
Know him. After all, we have tamed the beasts.

221
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:04,760
Tamed!

222
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:30,760
Wild beasts can be tamed into adorable pets.

223
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:41,760
Hi! Snake!

224
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:45,760
What do you want?

225
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:51,760
Rhinoceros and tigers have become pets for the Moomin family, but you're from a different country, aren't you?

226
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:52,760
I am.

227
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:55,760
I'll bring Niskuned and Moomin here.

228
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:59,760
Don't eat them, but bite them across the tail.

229
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:01,760
Clear.

230
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:09,760
I was really dumbfounded. It was so big you could have both sat in it.

231
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:11,760
I would like to see that giant snow.

232
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:15,760
You didn't just sow tropical seeds for these.

233
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:17,760
We sprinkled the past here and there.

234
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:21,760
There must have been an awful lot of seeds in the box.

235
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:24,760
If there are enough of them everywhere.

236
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:29,760
Where is the snow?

237
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:31,760
Those where?

238
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:34,760
There.

239
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:41,760
Hey, how wonderful.

240
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:46,760
You'll notice by now that I don't always speak slang.

241
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:52,760
The moon is so soft and delicate and beautiful.

242
00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:00,760
Moon in a boat is wonderfully romantic sailing.

243
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:05,760
Our former swamp seems to have turned into a luxurious mangrove swamp.

244
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:07,760
ha I Su Li!

245
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:10,760
Haisuli, hey!

246
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:11,760
I disappeared.

247
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:13,760
I don't see him anywhere.

248
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:18,760
Lummet seems to be riding the wind.

249
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:20,760
The dark night is approaching.

250
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:33,760
We need to get out.

251
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:34,760
Remind?

252
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:35,760
I don't know.

253
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:37,760
Look, there's the sea over there.

254
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:40,760
You show crocodile roads.

255
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:42,760
Niskunemi, look.

256
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:44,760
Or a boat.

257
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:48,760
We have to make it to the ship before the ship catches up with us.

258
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:04,760
Where?

259
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:06,760
There.

260
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:09,760
Niskuneiti, the ship is not far.

261
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:13,760
Good luck.

262
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:18,760
Moomin trolls swim as hard as they can.

263
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:24,760
They had a head start, but as you know, stingrays are fast swimmers.
