00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,000
One fine day something completely unheard of happened in Moomin Valley.

2
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Moomin went for a walk, which wasn't unusual, but what was unusual was that he forgot his hat.

3
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Hmm, could that be the father? It's no one else either, but where's dad's hat?

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Father, father!

5
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Aha, dad's hat!

6
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Hello, dare others!

7
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Hello mummy, papa.

8
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Daddy, where are you in such a hurry?

9
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
I'm going for a walk.

10
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Oh, it's you.

11
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Dad went out without a hat.

12
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Heavens, he's never done that.

13
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I run after to take dad's hat.

14
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Hi nuska muikkunen, Did dad go this way?

15
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Hmm, hmm, hmm...

16
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Ahh, wonderful.

17
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Hi, hi, hi, hi, hi...

18
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:09,000
My hat is lost, where could it be?

19
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
It has fallen on the way.

20
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Hurry back before someone steals it, strange that I didn't notice the drop of the hat.

21
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Have I become so old that I don't notice even if my head rolls off my shoulders?

22
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Moomin, Goblin, what are you doing?

23
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Hello, Hemuli.

24
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Oh, Moomin papa, I didn't know you without a hat.

25
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Has my hat been seen around here?

26
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
No, for God's sake, have you lost it?

27
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
I would assume.

28
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
You would suppose?

29
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:03,000
I just noticed I don't have a hat.

30
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
I don't really understand.

31
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
How can you not notice?

32
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
A hat?

33
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
I don't really understand.

34
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:15,000
How did you not notice when the hat probably flew off your head?

35
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Apparently it did, however.

36
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Yeah, pretty remarkable.

37
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
A big top hat anyway.

38
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Are you sure you put the hat on?

39
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,000
I am. Can't even put it on.

40
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Of course not, but I just thought you didn't get mad.

41
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Why would I get upset that someone thinks I'm wearing a hat?

42
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Not when I meant that maybe you forgot to put your hat on.

43
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
It hurts.

44
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:49,000
So I'm an old curmudgeon who goes out without a hat.

45
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
No, you're not crazy.

46
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
I just meant that we are getting older every day.

47
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Am I getting old?

48
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
No, no.

49
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Dad, dad, hello.

50
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
He has my hat.

51
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Part Moomin, Goblin.

52
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Father, I have been looking for you everywhere.

53
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
You forgot the hat.

54
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Oh, did I forget?

55
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Joo.

56
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
The hat was on the coat rack in the study.

57
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Oh yeah.

58
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:29,000
I had so many things in mind when I went out.

59
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Thank you, Moomin.

60
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:36,000
You were lucky you hadn't lost the hat after all.

61
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
You forgot to put your hat on.

62
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Of course, I didn't forget the table.

63
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
I just had more important things to think about.

64
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Absurd to suggest I'm getting old.

65
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Can even solve us for good.

66
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000
I think you are still quite young.

67
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Come on, have a good day, continue then, Hemuli.

68
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:02,000
But still I went out without a hat and didn't wear it.

69
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:07,000
That doesn't happen to young people.

70
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Where did the sticks come from?

71
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Oh.

72
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Mamma.

73
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
What, honey?

74
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Have you noticed that you kind of forget these days?

75
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Oh yes. It's nothing new.

76
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Oh, you too. It's amazing what kind of things you forget.

77
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Mostly little things, I guess. Nothing special comes to mind now.

78
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Right?

79
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Well papa, I guess you don't imagine that I remember things that I've forgotten.

80
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,000
You forgot, what did you forget?

81
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Same symptoms as me.

82
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Oh, the horror. This is serious.

83
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:17,000
What will happen to the children if mommy and I become jerks?

84
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:21,000
What will happen to the Moomin house and my scripts?

85
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:26,000
If mamma goes nuts, I have to stay sane.

86
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Then I have to take care of both mom and the kids.

87
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:36,000
I'm going to be a single parent.

88
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Just look at those wrinkles. I'm out of date.

89
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:48,000
When I close my eyes, I can't see the wrinkles, but I can feel them.

90
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:54,000
He can see the corner far from my youth at 45 degrees.

91
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:04,000
The key to youth lies in a healthy body and soul.

92
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Since there has never been anything wrong with my soul, the cause must be in the body.

93
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:24,000
I'm not getting old yet.

94
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:33,000
I will achieve eternal youth by practicing diligently.

95
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:38,000
I keep my brain fresh by doing new things.

96
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Oh my goodness, my nose is here.

97
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:03,000
My arms are too short.

98
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Oh!

99
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Father! What the hell?

100
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Nothing at all!

101
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,000
You hear disturbing sounds. May I come in?

102
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,000
No, you can't, you can't come.

103
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:58,000
The room is a little messy right now.

104
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:02,000
You are welcome after I have cleaned the room.

105
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,000
I'm hungry.

106
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Tasteless Peikko!

107
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Father!

108
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,000
I miss eating alone.

109
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Eat at the usual time, and you'll have company with us.

110
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,000
I know, but I've given up on daytime meals.

111
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Why the hell?

112
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:41,000
I thought it would be a change if I slept during the day and stayed awake at night.

113
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,000
But father, for what?

114
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:48,000
I want to break the monotonous routine of my life.

115
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Monotonous?

116
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Yes, I get up in the morning, wash, eat breakfast, eat lunch, take a nap, eat dinner, go to bed.

117
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Every day the same.

118
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:07,000
The next morning I wash, eat breakfast.

119
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:11,000
If you washed at night time?

120
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:17,000
That would be a small change. My life is in a groove, listen to this.

121
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:25,000
From the golden youth chapter, it is said that small life changes are recommended.

122
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Father, turning night into day is no small change.

123
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:40,000
If even a small change is good, then a complete upheaval of the daily schedule will make me years younger. For years!

124
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
You're serious.

125
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Of course. Give me a month and I'll be young enough to be your brother.

126
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Don't you believe?

127
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,000
We could play hide and seek together.

128
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Well, I'm going to bed. Good luck with the company.

129
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Thanks.

130
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
I hope the method works for you.

131
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
It sucks.

132
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Can I call dad dad if he becomes my age? Or should I call him Moominpapa?

133
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Moomin believes in the project and accepts it.

134
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
I have to get it done.

135
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Yep, you're jumping wrong.

136
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:43,000
I jump as I please. Your way is boring. Look at it this way. Give it a try.

137
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Alone.

138
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
I'll try too.

139
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Oh, I can't stop.

140
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Father.

141
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,000
What are you doing here? Why don't you take a nap in the hammock?

142
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:10,000
As I explained to you, I am now on night naps and not daytime naps.

143
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
You would sleep better in your own bed.

144
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Then I would never get sun and vitamin D.

145
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
And there is nothing in the bed.

146
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,000
I'm now on night naps and not daytime naps.

147
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Thanks, Dad.

148
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Uli pappa is a growth in karma.

149
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,900
Yes, he comes in another area.

150
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:33,300
we have it.

151
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
имеет pappale?

152
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:42,800
I'm not tär yol 라�pen y gaṃsānse

153
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:45,400
i will come

154
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:50,700
I don't want to miss 2015

155
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:55,700
Does everyone get old like that when they get older or is grandma papa the only one?

156
00:13:55,700 --> 00:14:00,700
Hopefully. I wouldn't want that kind of future waiting for me.

157
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:07,700
Hi mom.

158
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:09,700
Oh, you already came.

159
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:12,700
Mamma.

160
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:13,700
What?

161
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:14,700
Good night.

162
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:18,700
Good night.

163
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:21,700
Hey.

164
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:33,700
Mom, where are you going?

165
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:36,700
I picked flowers from the garden.

166
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:39,700
Granny, will you help?

167
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:41,700
Well, of course.

168
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:43,700
Oh Granny Goblin.

169
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:47,700
Nuuska Muikkunen and Miss Nisku, come along.

170
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:54,700
I would just be there on the road.

171
00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:59,700
Even the caveman, you're on the road no matter where you are.

172
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:05,700
Now there are many to pick us up.

173
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:08,700
Thank you, you are a great help.

174
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:10,700
We know how to pick up quickly.

175
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:15,700
So sure. Since there are so many of you, I thought I'd try one thing.

176
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:17,700
What matter?

177
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:22,700
Why don't you plan on picking all the flowers and taking them home?

178
00:15:22,700 --> 00:15:25,700
Yeah, that's what I thought.

179
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:30,700
Let's pick every single flower and take it to the Moomin house.

180
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:34,700
We will get through the job if we put our full heart into it.

181
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:39,700
Well, whatever, but let's do some preparations first.

182
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:44,700
Yes, a lot of boxes and baskets and carts are needed for transport.

183
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:46,700
And eväskori and limonaria!

184
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:49,700
Alright, let's get to work then.

185
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:53,700
But mom, why do you want to pick all the flowers?

186
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:57,700
Oh, I just came up with a plan.

187
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:10,700
Best to go deliver flowers right away.

188
00:16:10,700 --> 00:16:15,700
It is. Come on, kids, let's go home.

189
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:21,700
Grandma takes her fitness too seriously.

190
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:27,700
So take it. He doesn't think about anything else these days.

191
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:31,700
He is absent as if in a trance.

192
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:37,700
That's what I want to shake him off, in the most charming way possible.

193
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:41,700
I think I know what you're going to do with the flowers.

194
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:45,700
Which one would you succeed?

195
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:09,700
Oh!

196
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:29,700
I'm taking a nap tonight.

197
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:40,700
I'm taking a nap tonight.

198
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:13,700
Head, the day is breaking. I snoozed for too long.

199
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:20,700
Oh, cold. Feeling miserable. Off to bed soon.

200
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:24,700
But if I have slept all night, how can you sleep now?

201
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:29,700
And if I can't sleep during the day, how do I stay awake for nighttime exercise?

202
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:35,700
Oh, the horror if the fitness program doesn't suit me.

203
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:39,700
Oh!

204
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:02,700
Oh Impossible!

205
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:10,700
Mom's handprint is visible.

206
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:11,700
You are right.

207
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:14,700
But everyone helped me.

208
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:19,700
I have never been surprised in such a pleasant way.

209
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:22,700
It must be like you saw amen!

210
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:26,700
What do you think of the new-look Moomin house, papa?

211
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:31,700
I can think of no other word than wonderful.

212
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:35,700
That's enough thanks.

213
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:39,700
In the morning light, the Moomin house looks like a fairy tale.

214
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:42,700
Come and have a look.

215
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:52,700
Mom, I'd like to ask.

216
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:53,700
What, honey?

217
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:57,700
Why did you give me such a wonderful surprise?

218
00:19:57,700 --> 00:20:01,700
I just simply wanted to please you.

219
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:04,700
Really? Really?

220
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:06,700
Up, up.

221
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:11,700
I thought you needed some cheering up.

222
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:14,700
Thanks.

223
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:20,700
From that day Moominpappa returned to his usual lazy life.

224
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:23,700
Who could have slept for days?

225
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:30,700
Who could have slept for days when the house was so beautifully decorated?
