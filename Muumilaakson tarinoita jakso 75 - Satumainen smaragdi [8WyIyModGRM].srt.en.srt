1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
One night Moomin had a strange dream.

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
What have I gotten myself into?

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Go ahead, go ahead!

4
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Still forward, forward!

5
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Behind the waterfall you will find what you are looking for.

6
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I'm not looking for anything.

7
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Behind the waterfall!

8
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
What will I find there?

9
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Behind the waterfall!

10
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Well, that was an impressive dream.

11
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I've often dreamed that I'm falling or flying, but it's never happened to me in a dream that I'm looking for something.

12
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
So are you sure to search?

13
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:39,000
I've thought about it a lot, but I'm not looking for anything.

14
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Aha, have you seen that waterfall?

15
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Well, I'm not. Hey, wait, I've heard of one waterfall you can go behind.

16
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Who told about it?

17
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
You.

18
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Me?

19
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
You.

20
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
It does exist.

21
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
You said it's in the lonely mountains.

22
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
So I have told about the waterfall.

23
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Oh, take me there. Sleep bothers me so much that I can't think of it.

24
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
It was a dream.

25
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:13,000
The dream feels somehow ominous. Come with me.

26
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Ah, cooking milk.

27
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Good.

28
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I'm watering.

29
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Then go to sleep.

30
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
I think I'll go.

31
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Mother, I'm going on a trip to the lonely mountains with the new muikku in the morning.

32
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
What, before breakfast?

33
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Yeah, will you pack us some lunch?

34
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Of course.

35
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Thank you, good night.

36
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Mamma, where did Moomin Pekka say he was going?

37
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
To the lonely mountains.

38
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Quite far.

39
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Not too much.

40
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
So early and in such a strange direction.

41
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Just for fun.

42
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
He's hiding something.

43
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
How so?

44
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I don't think he was so tired that he needed to go to sleep.

45
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Oh, not about you?

46
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
He has something on his mind.

47
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
I feel the signs that you crave excitement.

48
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:11,000
He could get into trouble. I better follow him.

49
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Yes.

50
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Thanks, mom.

51
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Good morning, snort.

52
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Good morning.

53
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
I have snacks for both of us.

54
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Mother is a joy.

55
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Oh wonder.

56
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Moomin is soon after.

57
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Oh, you flowers anyway.

58
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:19,000
I didn't expect that this year at all.

59
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Excellent.

60
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Nice to see you flourishing.

61
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Ha!

62
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
I didn't know it was this far.

63
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Is it tiring?

64
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Little.

65
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Let's rest.

66
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Yes, I can. What about you?

67
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
I'm a wanderer.

68
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
The condition is disappointing.

69
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Exhausting to follow and stay hidden.

70
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Rest already.

71
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
After.

72
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Do you think we can find something?

73
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:25,000
I'm not so sure. It was just a dream.

74
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
So yes.

75
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,000
What if I march out and say I have vision.

76
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Maybe I could get something to eat.

77
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,000
No way. Then you could spy on them.

78
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
What exactly are they looking for?

79
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Something valuable huh?

80
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:45,000
This... This is the waterfall I saw in my dream.

81
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:49,000
But you really don't know what to look for.

82
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
No clue.

83
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Dreams are strange.

84
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Let's walk behind the falls and see what you should be looking for.

85
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
No clue.

86
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Dreams are strange.

87
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Let's walk behind the falls and see what you should be looking for.

88
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Let's walk behind the falls and see what you should be looking for.

89
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Doesn't look very inviting.

90
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Here's a slippery slope. I'll see where you step.

91
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
It's getting wet here!

92
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Now we have come right behind the waterfall.

93
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
I don't see anything special.

94
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
I can't see ahead yet.

95
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
What is that?

96
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
What so?

97
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Green thistle!

98
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Probably a smarak.

99
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
It's beautiful.

100
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Are you looking for an emerald in your dream?

101
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
I wasn't looking.

102
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
What else would you have been looking for?

103
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
There is nothing else here.

104
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:27,000
After all, anyone can look for such a fine smarak.

105
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
It's awfully big.

106
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,000
I mean, the biggest that exists.

107
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,000
If it were smaller, then Miss Ikon could keep it.

108
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Someone shouts.

109
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Someone is calling us.

110
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
There.

111
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Katsoppa.

112
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Help me!

113
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:57,000
At least I didn't dream of rescuing Haisuli.

114
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
He has overshadowed us.

115
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:03,000
For heaven's sake, stop messing around and try to help.

116
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:07,000
If you don't help me out on a terrible morning.

117
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,000
It stinks, yes we will help. Stay put.

118
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Stay, stay!

119
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,000
This is a bigger gem.

120
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,000
I would dream as good as a Moomin, Pekko.

121
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Me too.

122
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,000
But I didn't dream of jewels.

123
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Extremely fine.

124
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:48,000
But of course, we, the hemuli friend, appreciate rare plants more.

125
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Necessarily. I wouldn't trade them for anything.

126
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Not even to this raining rock. As beautiful as it is.

127
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Gems are the best I know.

128
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
I agree.

129
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Mom, you get the emerald.

130
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Thank you, Moomin Pekko.

131
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:09,000
I'd be fine with the emerald, but you have to keep it.

132
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Since your dream came true, you are meant to keep the emerald.

133
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:22,000
It's great, but what can you do with it?

134
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:38,000
That would be great letterpress, but I rarely get mail.

135
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
It will rain.

136
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Oh, will you?

137
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:06,000
If the kids are outside, they get soaked.

138
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:10,000
They get wet anyway because they went swimming.

139
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Now drop by drop.

140
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Let's go to the cave for shelter.

141
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
You're already wet.

142
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,000
I'm dry and I'm going to stay dry.

143
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Come on little sell, I'll take you to the cave.

144
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Ha ha, so you don't dare go there alone.

145
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Look, I'm afraid of very few things.

146
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
But one of them is Thunder.

147
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
In that style.

148
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
What rain?

149
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Hey, it's hailing.

150
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
This is too much.

151
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
It's raining so much that it hurts.

152
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Kasmini.

153
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
All my hair.

154
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Script

155
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
What's up with that?

156
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
How great.

157
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:49,200
Oh, oh, how long will I roll to this place.

158
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:57,000
The hailstorm passed.

159
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:00,400
Unprecedented hailstorms.

160
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:02,800
There must have been a lot of bad things.

161
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:03,800
So.

162
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Yes.

163
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Scarecrow! Disaster! The hail would knock out Hemul.

164
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Oh, the horror.

165
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Hemul is being carried here.

166
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Well, I can't carry a meter anymore.

167
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Don't always complain.

168
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Eyes get dark.

169
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Hemuli!

170
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Everything is ruined.

171
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Father, Raekkuuro destroyed Hemul's flower garden and greenhouse.

172
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
It's horrible.

173
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:52,000
All my plants, all my lovely flowers are crushed.

174
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
It's all over.

175
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Let's carry Hemuli inside.

176
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Speed up!

177
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Scarf dad, I'm rolling.

178
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
A pinch, don't exaggerate.

179
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:08,000
One step at a time, Nipsu, you can do it.

180
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Cut Hemuli in.

181
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Let's lower him gently onto the couch.

182
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
He has developed a high fever.

183
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,000
A nervous breakdown, I'm sure.

184
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Let's go mix the medicine right now.

185
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:28,000
My beloved plants, all gone.

186
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Don't go in the sky.

187
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,000
The garden will hardly be the same again.

188
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
In no way.

189
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Unless we do something, Hemuli will never recover in the world.

190
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:46,000
I'm sure the garden can be replanted.

191
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
It won't work.

192
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Of course we could plant some species, but Hemuli has collected plants from all over the world.

193
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Let's use magic.

194
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Would Noita be able to do something?

195
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
I doubt his abilities in this matter.

196
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Let's go ask anyway.

197
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:18,000
It's pointless for me to complain that Hemuli has been through a lot and that he won't recover.

198
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
But you are tough.

199
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:26,000
It's pointless for me to complain that Hemuli has been through a lot and that he won't recover.

200
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:32,000
But you're a Witch, Can't you really do anything for Hemul's garden?

201
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Not who I said it to, it goes beyond Martini.

202
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:40,000
But when Hemuli is so depressed that she can't get out of bed.

203
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
It doesn't increase my Martian.

204
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Let's go already.

205
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Moomin, too bad we weren't there to help.

206
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,000
If you can't do anything, then you can't.

207
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
It doesn't get better by grieving.

208
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Even a witch's power has its limits.

209
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
I have had to notice it.

210
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
It's sad.

211
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Hello then, Alisa.

212
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Hey hey.

213
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Ah, I made it up.

214
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
What did you get in your head?

215
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:21,000
What do you think, could the Magician restore the garden to its former state?

216
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Magician?

217
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Once we could wish for anything and the Magician made our wishes come true.

218
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:32,000
True, the Magician can help us, but how do we find him?

219
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Hi Alisa.

220
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
What?

221
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Could you ask grandma, Does she know how we can contact Tai Kuri?

222
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:50,000
And did you know where the Magician can be found?

223
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:55,000
Apparently, the witch jumped on a broomstick and went looking for him.

224
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Oh, shouldn't those be back already?

225
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
The magician doesn't live right next door.

226
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,000
We just have to wait.

227
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:06,000
I'm worried about Hemul.

228
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Don't worry, grandma is by her side.

229
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:12,000
Well, Hemuli rukka is better now.

230
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Ooo.

231
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:27,000
That's where the Magician comes on the Panther's back.

232
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
You didn't find those...

233
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
We must reward.

234
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
You didn't find those...

235
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,000
We must reward those witches.

236
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:42,000
I hope the Magician is in a good mood.

237
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:48,000
It never is, except when you got from tiudi and viudi to the royal order.

238
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
You called me.

239
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,000
We desperately need the Magician's help.

240
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:06,000
I'm not the kind of Magician who gets called in on a whim.

241
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Of course not, we are very sorry to trouble you.

242
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
No one else can help.

243
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:17,000
And last time the Magician made all our wishes come true.

244
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:21,000
But you also did me a great favor.

245
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,000
Besides, I don't make home visits.

246
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:29,000
And you have already received a reward for your service.

247
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Even a lot, if you allow me to add.

248
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Can we do another favor?

249
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,000
Forward.

250
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,000
Don't we?

251
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:40,000
No, no. Hardly.

252
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
How so?

253
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:45,000
You brought me happiness once, it won't happen again.

254
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,000
What favor could we do?

255
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,000
Five of it.

256
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
We want to know.

257
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
In for a penny in for a pound.

258
00:17:55,000 --> 00:18:00,000
With your help I finally got hold of the king ruby.

259
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
So?

260
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
But I'm missing.

261
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:07,000
The finest of emeralds, Queen Smaragdi.

262
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:11,000
I don't want to wait three hundred years.

263
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:15,000
I don't want to wait three hundred years.

264
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Emerald Moomin.

265
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
My magic, wait.

266
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Why?

267
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:44,000
This is it. This is it.

268
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
Queen Emerald.

269
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,000
I can't believe this is true.

270
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
Good night.

271
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,000
Good night.

272
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
Good night, my Troll.

273
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:54,000
After this incident, Moomin always fell asleep in the hope of a wonderful dream.

274
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:01,000
But if he was dreaming, he was dreaming.

275
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,000
This is.

276
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,000
This is.

277
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,000
This is.

278
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,000
This is.

279
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,000
This is.

280
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,000
This is.

281
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,000
This is.

282
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,000
This is.

283
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
This is.

284
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,000
This is.

285
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,000
This is.

286
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,000
This is.

287
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,000
This is.

288
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,000
This is.

289
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,000
This is.

290
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,000
This is.

291
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,000
This is.

292
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,000
This is.

293
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,000
This is.

294
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,000
This is.

295
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,000
This is.

296
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,000
This is.

297
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,000
This is.

298
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,000
This is.

299
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,000
This is.

300
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,000
This is.

301
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,000
This is.

302
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,000
This is.

303
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,000
This is.

304
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,000
This is.

305
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,000
This is.

306
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:32,500
This is.
