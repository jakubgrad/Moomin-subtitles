1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
I haven't accomplished anything in my life yet.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Something should be done.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Moomin troll.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
He said.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Breakfast is covered. Didn't you hear when I called?

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
No, sorry.

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
But I don't like anything now.

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
What's wrong with you? are you sick

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
In.

10
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Do you have a fever?

11
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
There is no fever.

12
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Mom, listen, you always cook for us.

13
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Yes, yes, yes. I will, but your father will get all the groceries.

14
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Well, what about this house?

15
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000
We built it together with your mother.

16
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
It took ten years to build.

17
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
It was a fun time.

18
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
I guessed it.

19
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
What did you guess?

20
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Let it be.

21
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Mom and Dad have always done everything for me.

22
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,000
When I have been sick, they have taken care of me.

23
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,000
And I haven't done anything like that myself.

24
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Good morning, Nuuska Muikkunen.

25
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Good morning, Moomin Goofy.

26
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
You're on the move early.

27
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
I have a question.

28
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
About what?

29
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Well, I wish you would tell me how I could become as independent as you.

30
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,000
I'll tell you now what the matter is.

31
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
I want to do something of my own.

32
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,000
I'll lose myself if I don't get to control my life.

33
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
You tell me.

34
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
What should I do?

35
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Listen now.

36
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Don't ask others what you need to do.

37
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Father!

38
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
What's wrong now?

39
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Dad, I have something to do.

40
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Oh, well, tell me what's on your mind.

41
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:17,000
The one when I would like to decide my own life.

42
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
What do you really need?

43
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
What exactly do you mean?

44
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:27,000
You and mom have done everything for me so far.

45
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
I do understand that.

46
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Ah, so what?

47
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Well, I would like to know how I could decide on my own life from now on.

48
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Oh, that's why you were like catnip this morning.

49
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:47,000
You have reached a new milestone in your life.

50
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Oh, am I?

51
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
You are, Moomin.

52
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:55,000
You have now stepped on the threshold of a new life.

53
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:59,000
You start opening your own yard as a time worker.

54
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:03,000
You are laying the first foundation stones on the highway of life.

55
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:07,000
I think I have a little tip for you.

56
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Namely, a book about Robinson Crusoe.

57
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
You read that book.

58
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
I will definitely read, thanks dad.

59
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Hurrah!

60
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Come on, Moomin.

61
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Oh, this all reminds me of my own youth.

62
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Not this, and not this.

63
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Here it is.

64
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
I found it.

65
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Well, Robinson Crusoe is adventures.

66
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:43,000
The fury of the storm became more and more terrible.

67
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Two nearby heavy cargo ships had their masts snapped.

68
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:59,000
While the wind was still blowing furiously, one morning a cry was suddenly heard from the mast in sight of the land.

69
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Hardly had we all made it to the deck when our ship hit a sand bar and came to a rest.

70
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:13,000
After getting myself an apartment, my biggest concern was to find a place where I could tune the white.

71
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:17,000
I can probably live with worse shortcomings here.

72
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Oh, how fascinating.

73
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Robinson Crusoe lived on a desert island on his own terms.

74
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Would I be able to do the same?

75
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
I'm no worse.

76
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Robinson was just an ordinary boy.

77
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
I can if he could.

78
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:50,000
I go to sea and make sure my ship gets wrecked.

79
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Hey, mom.

80
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Hello, Moomin. Are you feeling better?

81
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Yes, I have decided to go to sea.

82
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,000
I'm going to follow in Robinson Crusoe's footsteps.

83
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Are you serious?

84
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
I am.

85
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:12,000
I get shipwrecked, but I land on a deserted island and start living there.

86
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Mom, he's not blocking me.

87
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:19,000
I have made my decision and from now on I will live my own life.

88
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
I'm not blocking you.

89
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Mother!

90
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Sounds fun. Good luck on your journey.

91
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Well, I have to go pack. A very busy day.

92
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:40,000
First of all, I need a diary where I can write down everything that happens to me.

93
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Then I need a pen and a large drinking glass, scissors, a nail, a clipper, binoculars and a towel.

94
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Now I'm ready.

95
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Mom, I'll have some dinner.

96
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Just take it.

97
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Now fit into it.

98
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Sweetheart.

99
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
So what now?

100
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Moomin goes to sea. He is going to live his own life in the same way as Robinson Crusoe.

101
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Or will he start living like Robinson Crusoe?

102
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
But it's really great.

103
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Dad, can I borrow the boat?

104
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
With pleasure.

105
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,000
I probably can't return it in the same condition.

106
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Oh, for what?

107
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Because I have to get shipwrecked.

108
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Ooo, we live in exciting times.

109
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Absolutely.

110
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Mamma, did you hear what Moomin said?

111
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,000
I wish I could be young again.

112
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:53,000
I would immediately go on an adventure without a trace of fear.

113
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
How exciting?

114
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Hey, over here, over here.

115
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Here, here, here, here, here.

116
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Moomin, where are you going with such a big backpack?

117
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Don't say, you've invented a new game.

118
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Let me guess what game it is.

119
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Moomin, what game is that?

120
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000
First of all, the question is not a joke.

121
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
So what?

122
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,000
I will go to sea and start living on my own.

123
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Hohoho, and can you go to sea?

124
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Have you egged yourself on?

125
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:31,000
I'm going to the seas, to the seas, and not to the destination.

126
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Oh, to the sea.

127
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Yes, I will move to a deserted island and live like Robinson Crusoe.

128
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Why?

129
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Sounds original.

130
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Moomin, can I come along?

131
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Yes?

132
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,000
If Niiskuneti can come, I will too.

133
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Is a lot of money needed there?

134
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Of course not. What can you buy on a deserted island?

135
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Aha, well then I can come too.

136
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Yes, but like Robinson Crusoe lived on a deserted island without companions.

137
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:07,000
It doesn't matter if you have a few friends with you.

138
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Let's help Moomin to carry the luggage.

139
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
It suits me.

140
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
And to me.

141
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Hey, wait.

142
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
GP.

143
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
It happens.

144
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Hey listen.

145
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:22,000
We go to the seas, to the seas and we also get there.

146
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
To the sea, to the destination.

147
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Um, why did they have to get involved in this?

148
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,000
To the sea, to the sea, to the sea, bye.

149
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Wake up.

150
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,000
The boat is already fully loaded.

151
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,000
There you go, now it works.

152
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,000
I fixed it, the rudder and now it's fine.

153
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Do you notice how handy I am?

154
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:47,000
There is no such fault that you cannot fix.

155
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Mummy Moomin.

156
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Welcome, Little Myy.

157
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
I can't take them with me.

158
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,000
My whole life depends on this thing.

159
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
I have made my decision.

160
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
I'll let them know it won't work.

161
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,000
I go to sea alone or I don't go at all.

162
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
That's what I tell everyone.

163
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
I'll say for sure.

164
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Moomin, hurry.

165
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Don't leave your own trip.

166
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Oh, Mom and Dad, what are you doing here?

167
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Moominmamma and Moominpapa go with them.

168
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Kasku, I want to join your youth.

169
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:27,000
I also want to participate in exciting long-distance sailing.

170
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
I can come along.

171
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Well, me and my mother.

172
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
We would like that.

173
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Oh.

174
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
I wish you a happy journey.

175
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Thank you, Aren't you coming?

176
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:48,000
I don't think so, but I hope everything goes well and the winds are favorable.

177
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,000
I mean I wish you a real shipwreck.

178
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Oh, thanks.

179
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Let's go already.

180
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
What's delaying it?

181
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
You let go.

182
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
For sailing.

183
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Moomin, baller?

184
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Upward facing.

185
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Sail up, Moomin. Let's go on sea adventures.

186
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Take care of yourselves.

187
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Now delicious sandwiches.

188
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Our sailing trip has begun, children.

189
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
The best feed you can get.

190
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:24,000
You just sink to the bottom like a rock when we run aground.

191
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
You want my bread?

192
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,000
This was not supposed to be a picnic.

193
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Oh, there's an island over there.

194
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Moomin look, there's an island.

195
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Let's go ashore there.

196
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,000
And no, we're not shipwrecked yet.

197
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Still thinking about the shipwreck?

198
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Of course.

199
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Oh no, I can't even swim a meter.

200
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Mamma, look how the moon shines.

201
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Lovely, I'm glad we went along.

202
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
What was it?

203
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,000
We clearly hit something.

204
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Oh, papa, look at that.

205
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
What is this?

206
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Must not.

207
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Must not.

208
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Must not.

209
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Must not.

210
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Must not.

211
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Must not.

212
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Remarkable.

213
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Odd.

214
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
At least this is a magazine, right?

215
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:33,000
How could deciduous trees suddenly grow in the middle of the sea?

216
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Oh, how beautiful.

217
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Father look, trees grow straight out of the sea.

218
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Yeah, I can see that.

219
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
It's very strange.

220
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
It really is.

221
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
We ran aground.

222
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
The boat sinks.

223
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Good luck, now there were problems.

224
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Shipwreck, shipwreck, the adventure can begin.

225
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
I don't want a shipwreck.

226
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
What is it?

227
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:20,000
The pinch calms down, the water doesn't come in anymore, see?

228
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Branches and leaves block the leak.

229
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Surely we don't have to worry?

230
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,000
We will reassess the situation after the sun has risen.

231
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Oh yeah, we were shipwrecked.

232
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
No one is visible, where everyone is.

233
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Moomin troll.

234
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Hyperys, we're down.

235
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Good morning, Moomin.

236
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Good morning.

237
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Hey, how did you get there?

238
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Moomin land here.

239
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Robinson always got up on time.

240
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
What has happened?

241
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Where is all the water?

242
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Oh, I guess it didn't happen to you.

243
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
No.

244
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Surprisingly, here is an island.

245
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Is it?

246
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
On, on.

247
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Last night was probably a higher than usual high tide.

248
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Let's go.

249
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
The water reached almost to the top of the trees.

250
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
We are on an island.

251
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
What a stroke of luck.

252
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
I was shipwrecked.

253
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,000
I get to start an independent life on a deserted island.

254
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
It tastes good.

255
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Moomin comes to eat breakfast.

256
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Come on, my darling.

257
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
I don't want any breakfast.

258
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
What for?

259
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Because I'm starting to live alone now.

260
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Share, just like that.

261
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Don't bring your own breakfast.

262
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
I live my own life, bye.

263
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Moomin, let him go.

264
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Which of our Moomins just wouldn't get into trouble.

265
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
How lucky I was to find breakfast like this.

266
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
I am very fine.

267
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
I am very fine.

268
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
I'm great.

269
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
I'm great.

270
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
I'm great.

271
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
I'm great.

272
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Great drinking water suddenly.

273
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Now I have to go fishing.

274
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
I catch a really big fish.

275
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Moomin, we're going to the swimming pool.

276
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
At the same time, we will collect something to eat for you too.

277
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Blacksmithing.

278
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Hei isiteden!

279
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Dad, what do you think?

280
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
How will Moomin survive?

281
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Don't worry, he is our son.

282
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
He always makes it!

283
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:02,000
He is our son. He always makes it.

284
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
I'm bored.

285
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
What was that sound?

286
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
It would be fun to know.

287
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:20,000
I have such a feeling...

288
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Dude, what happened?

289
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Mom, I think there's someone behind us.

290
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
I think so too.

291
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Cry?

292
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Oh!

293
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,000
You can probably make a good soup out of these mussels.

294
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
You can! Are you sulking!

295
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Hey.

296
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
Where is your camp?

297
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
In the forest, by the stream.

298
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
But don't come there.

299
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Oh why?

300
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:12,000
Because I have to survive on my own, like Robinson Crusoe.

301
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
I don't have time for you.

302
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Hey are you?

303
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Now I'm freaking out. It's a big fish.

304
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Car talk.

305
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Monsters!

306
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Moominpapa, what happened?

307
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Wake up, Moominpapa!

308
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
What was I doing?

309
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Who has been here?

310
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
Look, a tent.

311
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Now I remember, monsters!

312
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Monsters!

313
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Monsters!

314
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Monsters!

315
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
Monsters!

316
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Monsters!

317
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Monsters!

318
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
We have to tell Moomin about them right away.

319
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
Monster!

320
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
A real monster!

321
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
Oh my tent.

322
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
The monster did this.

323
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
More monsters!

324
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
What would Robinson have done in this situation?

325
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
That book didn't talk about monsters.

326
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Moomin!

327
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Sell and niskuneiti.

328
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Aha, you monsters scared Moominmamma and Moominpapa.

329
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
Myy is careful.

330
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:40,000
On top of everything, you still steal pots and pans.

331
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
Give them back.

332
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
Pots and pans back.

333
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
It's too late to regret now.

334
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
All the goods back right away.

335
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Did you hear?

336
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
What is it now?

337
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
Myy monster seems Weird.

338
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Just when he wanted to tell us something.

339
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
Now they go away.

340
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
Can you have us come along?

341
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Let's go anyway.

342
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
Yeah, sure.

343
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
What has happened to this?

344
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
It's stuck between the roots.

345
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
Mite!

346
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
I guess it won't bite.

347
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
I'll stop by and see.

348
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
It is in poor condition.

349
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
I feel sorry for you.

350
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:46,000
It has such a big belly that it can't move forward.

351
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
I think it's expecting a baby.

352
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
Baby! That's just fun!

353
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
We have to get the monster out.

354
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
We have to get the monster out.

355
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
We have to get the monster out.

356
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:00,000
When you just take it off, you're the Robinson Crusoe.

357
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
When you just take it off, you're the Robinson Crusoe.

358
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
And you do everything alone, that's how it was.

359
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
And you do everything alone, that's how it was.

360
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
Yeah, yeah, but wait.

361
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
The other monsters were in the water.

362
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
The other monsters were in the water.

363
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
Last night when we came.

364
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
The morning dawned and there was low tide.

365
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
The monster stayed on dry land.

366
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
Water!

367
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
Water is salvation.

368
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
The monster seems to do poorly on dry land.

369
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
The other monsters try to make it easier.

370
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
The other monsters try to make it easier.

371
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
Hey, let's do our best.

372
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
Clear!

373
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
Mummipeukko, let's go ask mummamma and mummappa for help.

374
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
Mummipeukko, let's go ask mummamma and mummappa for help.

375
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
Let's do that, and now everyone to get water.

376
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
Clear!

377
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
Uh!

378
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
Sell, is it ready?

379
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
It is, it is, it is, let it come!

380
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
How is it?

381
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
Much better!

382
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
Fun!

383
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
Cold!

384
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
Hey, look at the egg!

385
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
An awful lot of flushing for one egg.

386
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
But yes it is huge!

387
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
How many omelets would it make?

388
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
Torvelo!

389
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
Now our monster would be able to get away with it!

390
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
Yes, you did great!

391
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
Can't say more!

392
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
Can't say more!

393
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
Can't say more!

394
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:42,000
I've gotten the idea that monsters come from far away to spawn here.

395
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
I've gotten the idea that monsters come from far away to spawn here.

396
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
Will.

397
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
Mamma, we have to go.

398
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
I guess so.

399
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
I guess so.

400
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
Sell, is the rudder ok?

401
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
All right.

402
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,000
Pipsu, hurry up, the water will rise soon.

403
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
I know.

404
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,000
Moomin has changed a lot here.

405
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:12,000
Yeah, he's suddenly grown big and sensible.

406
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:19,000
Nothing is as useful for growing up as reading good books.

407
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:23,000
He still has some learning to do.
