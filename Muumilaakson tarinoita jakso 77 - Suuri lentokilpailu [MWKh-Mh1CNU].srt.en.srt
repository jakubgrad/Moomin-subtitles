1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Hey, would you like to take me on your back when you take off?

2
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Hello! Why don't you answer?

3
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Hit miss, where are you going?

4
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Let's see mommy.

5
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Well that's not new! It's stupid to run after!

6
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
No! Something has happened!

7
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Hey!

8
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Oh you!

9
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Well, what is it now?

10
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Isku is finally trying out the aircraft.

11
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Right away?

12
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Yes, it's great to see, even if you walk a little slower.

13
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Why is everyone running?

14
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:10,000
They went to help Isku. The tent still needs to be dismantled around the aircraft and the ball is inflated with gas.

15
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Come on now!

16
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Isku's aircraft is finally completed.

17
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Does it look weird? Well, it hasn't been gassed yet.

18
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Now the ball is filled with gas, which is much lighter than air.

19
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:43,000
And when the ship is in the air, it is steered by this propeller. So you don't have to fly just with the wind.

20
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Iskuneiti sector is filling up!

21
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Clear!

22
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Mummy, mamma and black, how are they going to be stoned?

23
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Oh, we're getting ready here.

24
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Thank you for coming, dear friends. Soon my ship will rise into the air like a swan and know that it will fly even in the wind.

25
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Thanks. Thank you, thank you.

26
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

27
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Look!

28
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
What is there?

29
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Another aircraft!

30
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Not exactly a flying basket!

31
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Well Johan now, someone has stolen it so I can figure it out.

32
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Oh my, this is not true.

33
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Good day gentlemen, Do you remember me? I came to visit again.

34
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Yes, we remember Mr. Brisk, who could forget.

35
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
The last time he skied!

36
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Yes, and ate all the jam from us.

37
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:21,000
We had so much fun last winter that you must have missed me. Do you still have jam? I'll be there as soon as I land.

38
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:25,000
And I was sure that I was the first.

39
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Oh, the horror!

40
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
The ball was too full.

41
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
I'm getting ready!

42
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
It's hard right now.

43
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Don't worry, dashing Hemul's ship is just a basket as a girl.

44
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Not when the ship is much bigger.

45
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Kompas, you've really rocked.

46
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:58,000
I would like to see how this ship flies first.

47
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Let's go look at that other trick.

48
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
I'll go along.

49
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
I am also interested in the intentions of the guest.

50
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
We need to conduct an inspection of the ship.

51
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Hello, baby!

52
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Good to watch flying, your basket!

53
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
How fast does it fly?

54
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
How so?

55
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
So will it win?

56
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Of course it wins.

57
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
So when the aircraft has an engine.

58
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,000
I think it will win the race.

59
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Really? How fast does it fly?

60
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Hard to say when it hasn't flown yet.

61
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Gas leaked out.

62
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Ha, movie troll!

63
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Hemme who expected uncle this early.

64
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Winter hasn't come yet.

65
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Has it stopped skiing?

66
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
No, but I can get to the slopes faster by flying.

67
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,000
The dashing Hemul's Laundry basket is lost on my plane.

68
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Without a doubt, Niisku.

69
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
And he's gone with the wind.

70
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:21,000
You can turn in any direction and even fly into the wind.

71
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
That's right.

72
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Sure enough.

73
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Palla's ship quickly fixed.

74
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,000
But I still think it's unfair that that crazy stranger

75
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,000
just arriving on my first day of flying.

76
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
This jam is great.

77
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,000
That's actually why I came.

78
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
There was still some left in the cellar.

79
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Even I can't take it anymore.

80
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
That's good, Moomin.

81
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Thank you for your courtesy.

82
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Would you like some jam?

83
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
I was waiting for those words.

84
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,000
As much as you need.

85
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Jam into the jam with pancakes.

86
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Now what?

87
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
I saw someone flying past the window.

88
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Ugh, weird.

89
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Oh, would Niisku have already fixed his aircraft?

90
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,000
No, the pilot must have been a witch.

91
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
That's it!

92
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,000
He always knocks on the door with a bone.

93
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Moomoo, why don't you tap your knuckles?

94
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Because I'm a witch.

95
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Hello, this is a surprise.

96
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:39,000
One day I saw a strange flying device, which must have landed on a patch of land.

97
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
That's right, the pilot is sitting here.

98
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Oops, a real witch.

99
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Dad right and when I fly, I fly with the right broom.

100
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,000
I've been feeling good since the old days.

101
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:02,000
You have to go with development, and development is flying with tools that you can build.

102
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,000
I make a broom myself in five minutes.

103
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,000
It must be uncomfortable to sit on a broomstick.

104
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Someone seems to have built a real aircraft here.

105
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
It hasn't flown yet.

106
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
But my ship is.

107
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:24,000
You may also say that my hot air balloon flies better than an old broom.

108
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
And not fly.

109
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Yes, it flies. Besides, only witches can fly on broomsticks.

110
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Well, shall we compete?

111
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
How?

112
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:37,000
I fly on my own broom and you fly in your flying laundry basket.

113
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Okay, I accept the challenge.

114
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
How do we proceed?

115
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:46,000
We choose our quantity, take something from there and return.

116
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Well, where are we going?

117
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Moompa, do you have any suggestions?

118
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Mmm, that... What do you think, Nuuska Muikkunen?

119
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Would you visit the top of the lonely mountains?

120
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Wow, that's an excellent destination.

121
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Hemuli listen, Do you know anything that only grows there?

122
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:11,000
A star-shaped white flower grows at the top, and there is no lower one.

123
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Whoever brings first, who wins?

124
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
And the winner is me.

125
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
I'm going to win the air race.

126
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
You win, I always win.

127
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Do not release the ropes until I give permission.

128
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
No, no, trust us.

129
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:39,000
And then this. Hemuli, don't let go.

130
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Grandma, are you sure you'll win?

131
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:46,000
I'm the witch. I'll win, you fool.

132
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:50,000
You don't know that. The dashing Hemuli seems so sure of victory.

133
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,000
It could be embarrassing for you if that happens...

134
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,000
The dasher here gets embarrassed, and no one else.

135
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:02,000
That's it, I'm ready. Fuck that witch.

136
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
I'm ready, Toope.

137
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Then don't get mad if you lose.

138
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Remember, participation is important, not winning.

139
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
I'll show you the losses.

140
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,000
All right. Facing lonely mountains. Loose.

141
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
I kept crying.

142
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Oh, not selling. Right down from there.

143
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Start! Ate kapju go.

144
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Don't stop, it's going to sell.

145
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,000
The laundry gets fixed like in lice tar.

146
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Is it your best?

147
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Absolutely.

148
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
An unequal race.

149
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Too early to say.

150
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Mr. Reippailija's ball also increases speed.

151
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,000
I could have flown there too.

152
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Mr. Reippailija is guaranteed not to win the air race.

153
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Niisku's flying horse would be from another country.

154
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Has it been fixed?

155
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:23,000
They would have waited for Niisku long enough to have a more interesting competition.

156
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Let's go to Niiskulu.

157
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,000
I'm sure that Niisku's miracle glue has already started to dry.

158
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Yes, competition will develop from this.

159
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Moomin, can I come along?

160
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Of course you can.

161
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,000
But shouldn't you stay and see if your grandma wins?

162
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Maybe, but get so nervous that I have to get something else to think about.

163
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Let's go then.

164
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:00,000
I have to admit that I have seen even more exciting competitions.

165
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Or what mom?

166
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:07,000
I like calm races, during which you can take a nap.

167
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
So do I.

168
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
The grass smells so good.

169
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
A trick from the water.

170
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
It doesn't leak anymore.

171
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
I don't think so.

172
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Soon in the sky like a bird.

173
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Hopefully. It really pisses me off that I'm not the first.

174
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Reippailijan's Laundry basket is nothing compared to your dishes. Kinda beautiful.

175
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
There's gas in the ball again!

176
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Moomin Pekka!

177
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
I'm getting wet!

178
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Glad you came. You just came to see my test flight.

179
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
That's cuter than Reippailija's basket.

180
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
It sure is. Shall we begin?

181
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Oh Niisku, wait a little longer.

182
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Mom and dad watch the race between Noida and Reippailija.

183
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,000
These have not yet returned from the lonely mountains.

184
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:25,000
I'd like mom and dad to see your first flight.

185
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Good, do I have to wait long?

186
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Look! Grandma will be back soon.

187
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:40,000
I'm glad the Rogue lost to the witch.

188
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Grandma!

189
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,000
This is what grows at the top.

190
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Thanks for the gift. I'm going to plant a rare seedling right away.

191
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Where does Mr. Reippailija stay, you say?

192
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Judging by his pace, he may still be on his way to the lonely mountains.

193
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:09,000
His laundry basket seemed rudimentary, in a technical sense.

194
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,000
No broom, Neraten. Where are you Alisa?

195
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Went to see the beginning of Niisku.

196
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:19,000
That's where Alisa comes from. Niisku is also included.

197
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Did you fix your ship?

198
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:27,000
I got it. Then Niisku gets to take the test flight.

199
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Listen Noita, you should also fly a race with Niisku.

200
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:38,000
It's an organization, but it's the same if Niisku wants and he can get his ship into the air.

201
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:44,000
The witch has already returned. He was going at such a good pace.

202
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Now that I got up here, I could pick anyone up.

203
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:55,000
But when I failed to plan, how do you return to a headwind without your engine?

204
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:02,000
There's still a bit of jam left, if only I could keep going.

205
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:12,000
It's been a memorable day, hasn't it?

206
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Yes, papa.

207
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Imagine, we had a brisk hemuli, but we still had jam left.

208
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:22,000
We had a flight competition, but there is still a test flight coming up.

209
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Let's hope it goes well.

210
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Oh, of course it's going well Niisku.

211
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Just thank you. For the first time in my life, I feel insecure.

212
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Niisku miss, turn off the gas tap.

213
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Mmm, mmm, mmm.

214
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,000
The trick seems faster than a laundry basket.

215
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:59,000
If it can get up in the air at all.

216
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
So you think you can't?

217
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:05,000
The tractor weighs at least a ton because it has a house and everything.

218
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Well, the field is empty in front of the ship.

219
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Takeoff requires a runway.

220
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Move a little further.

221
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Oh, where is Myy?

222
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Ha, Sell!

223
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Niisku, Myy may be hidden in your ship.

224
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Ah, you you.

225
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Sell, have you locked the door?

226
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Open!

227
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
Calm down Niisku!

228
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Sell, open now!

229
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Stop it, I can't focus on these levers.

230
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Focus? What?

231
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:47,000
To focus on the levers. Hey Myy, you're not just trying to start the engine, are you?

232
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:51,000
I'm curious to see what the mic lever can do.

233
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Hey, hurry up and hold on to the ship, Myy has shoved himself into the cockpit and is trying to board.

234
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Would Myy be able to get the ship into the air?

235
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,000
Of course not, it's impossible.

236
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:12,000
But if he somehow succeeded then, I wouldn't be the first to fly on my own ship, and I wouldn't be able to handle it with Takuu.

237
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Oh, you're afraid I'll start the trick.

238
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Sell, stop this madness and get out.

239
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Sell, please.

240
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,000
A little magic could be in order.

241
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Oops, the door is open.

242
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Let me come along!

243
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:32,000
You can come, but today, because it's a test flight.

244
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
It's dangerous.

245
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,000
You think something might happen?

246
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:43,000
Not going to happen, the ship is well designed.

247
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
Well, in that case, I can come along.

248
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Anything can happen with you.

249
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
What did that mean?

250
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Sell, stop.

251
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Calm down, little one, I promise you'll get on the first flight I take passengers on.

252
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:02,000
What if there is a gas leak or the ship goes awry?

253
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Then I'll ever get on board.

254
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
Little boy, why do you say that?

255
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:09,000
My brother's ship won't go astray.

256
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Well, now I'm sniffing the air.

257
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
Be careful.

258
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Land happily.

259
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Thanks.

260
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Don't be restless.

261
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Nisku knows what he's doing.

262
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
The ship moves forward.

263
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
The ship can't rise.

264
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
It just slides along the grass.

265
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
Why didn't I get to the helm?

266
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
Wax!

267
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
I want to.

268
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
I want to.

269
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
I want to.

270
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
I want to.

271
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
I want to.

272
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
I want to.

273
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
I want to.

274
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
It was close.

275
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:19,000
The laundry basket may be slower, but at least it takes off.

276
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
Even a low salary.

277
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:24,000
There is still hope, dear Miss Nisku.

278
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
The ship is coming straight at us.

279
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
Best to run away.

280
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Ai!

281
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
Ai!

282
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
Ai!

283
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
I want to.

284
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
I want to.

285
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
I want to.

286
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
I want to.

287
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
I want to.

288
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
I want to.

289
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
I want to.

290
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
I want to.

291
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
Oh grandma!

292
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
Oh, oh, I had to.

293
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
A witch is embarrassed to fly on her nose.

294
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
The bone also fell.

295
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
Grandma, watch out!

296
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Nisku, don't come away!

297
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
Grandma hurry up!

298
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
Run away from below!

299
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
Get up, now get up, up!

300
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
Alisha!

301
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
Fly, oh fly!

302
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
Nisku, don't go.

303
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
Nisku did it, he flies.

304
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
I want to.

305
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
I want to.

306
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
I want to.

307
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
I want to.

308
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
I want to.

309
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
I want to.

310
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
I made it, I made it.

311
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
I'm finally flying.

312
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
Disgusting means of transportation.

313
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
It's better than your broom.

314
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
Not as convenient.

315
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
How so?

316
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,000
Test method of nozzles on an aircraft.

317
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:19,000
Be careful not to get caught by a leotard like me!

318
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:26,000
Thanks for watching the video!
