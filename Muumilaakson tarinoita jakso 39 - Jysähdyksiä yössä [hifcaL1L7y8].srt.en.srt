1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:27,000
There had been loud bangs in the Moomin lakso lately. Usually only one a night, but sometimes two.

2
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Did you wake up to a commotion?

3
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Yeah, and when I think about those sharpies, I can't sleep.

4
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
I'll see if there's another one.

5
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
The shocks come from the north.

6
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Oh, I thought from the east.

7
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
They hardly come from the mountains.

8
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
I doubt the witch has anything to do with it.

9
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Why should they make such a fuss?

10
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
You don't know that. Witches are Slytherins.

11
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,000
I'm going to see the chief of police tomorrow. He gets permission to put an end to the fuss.

12
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Dad, I don't think that makes sense.

13
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Why not? The first jolt wakes me up and then I'm left to follow another one that might not come.

14
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,000
It could be that the thuds are an echo from somewhere further away.

15
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Ai.

16
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Right. Nuuska Muikkunen thinks so.

17
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Do you mean the pounding is coming from the sea?

18
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Yes, Nuuska Muikkunen thinks. You know, even if the pirates were banging.

19
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I'm still betting on tins. The rustling sounds come from the woods.

20
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
What are you two talking about here?

21
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
We await another rumble.

22
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
You may wait in vain.

23
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
How do you know that?

24
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:47,000
There were two crashes last night, and there have never been two crashes in consecutive nights.

25
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Except now.

26
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Did you hear the sound clearly coming from there?

27
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
From the east.

28
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
No, it came from that direction.

29
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
There is no doubt about it.

30
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Good morning, Moomin Pekko.

31
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Good morning.

32
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
You look tired.

33
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:21,000
You too would show if Yrinä had supervised you.

34
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
They are quite remarkable thuds.

35
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Hey listen, will you go on a witch hunt with me?

36
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Dad is sure that the witch will cause a chill.

37
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
That's where you go wrong.

38
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
That's what I said too, but I couldn't convince dad.

39
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
I'm going to find out about it.

40
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,000
You can tell that from the thumps, but maybe not tell us.

41
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Let's ask.

42
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Witches don't have to lie.

43
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
And sell again.

44
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
You go again!

45
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Hi my, are you shadowing me full time?

46
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Only when you're trying to sneak away somewhere.

47
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
I'm just taking a walk.

48
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Yes, but even now you're walking sloppily.

49
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,000
The witch just kept you from waking up.

50
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,000
And now he's trying to prevent you from sleeping.

51
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,000
But Moomins aren't the only ones who suffer from the bumps.

52
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:37,000
I consider it possible that the Moomins are not the witch's target after all.

53
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:43,000
I wake up, you just once and I don't know anything about the thump.

54
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
You're thick-skinned too.

55
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Are there witches at home?

56
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
If not, we can play with Alisa.

57
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:59,000
If we want to know the truth about the thuds, it's better to ask Alisa.

58
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
It is.

59
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,000
The fact that you seem to understand that this is a witch's cabin.

60
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
What do you mean?

61
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:19,000
The fact that my reputation will suffer if I am seen in the company of such vällers.

62
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Huh? Your reputation is long gone. Because of us, we...

63
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,000
That... We have a few questions.

64
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Then we'll go home right away.

65
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Is Alisa's chamber in the attic?

66
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
There it is.

67
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Is Alisa at home?

68
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
There isn't.

69
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Where is he?

70
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Looking for herbs.

71
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
When will he return?

72
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Was that your thing?

73
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:58,000
No. I will answer honestly. What is all the fuss about?

74
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Ah, that's it.

75
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Ho, you know. You make those thumps.

76
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Well, not really.

77
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Who then?

78
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
It would be fun to know.

79
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Then why did you say that?

80
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
The jerks bother me too.

81
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Are they coming close?

82
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Not far away. Maybe facing the sea.

83
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Muikkunen thinks the same.

84
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:24,000
All the sounds from the sea echo off the lonely mountains.

85
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Senate kid!

86
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,000
I went to the beach a couple of days ago to see if there was anything there?

87
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:35,000
A witch needs a night's sleep after all the witching and casting spells.

88
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Well, did anything work out?

89
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:43,000
No. There was only one thunder that night, and nothing was visible on the beach when I finally got there.

90
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,000
At least it wasn't you.

91
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,000
What makes you think it was me?

92
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:55,000
When I really fart, it's really not a camel fart.

93
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Oh camel fart!

94
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Thank you, Miss Niisku.

95
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,000
I am going to grow black tulips this year.

96
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Are there any?

97
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Well, they are quite dark red.

98
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Yes.

99
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:24,000
But somewhere in the world you can grow cypress tulips.

100
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Let's go and ask Hemul right away.

101
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Let's go.

102
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Likes me.

103
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
There's nothing to be ashamed of.

104
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,000
I wake up to that noise every night too.

105
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Are you making a fuss?

106
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Well, exactly.

107
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Oh yeah, that's it.

108
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Do you know anything about it?

109
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
I don't know.

110
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:50,000
But I won't try to take over because of those thumps.

111
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
So?

112
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
So.

113
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Do you know anything about it?

114
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
I don't know.

115
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,000
But it's not because of those thumps that I try to keep watch.

116
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:03,000
I am waiting for an answer from the botanical society.

117
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Really?

118
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Joo.

119
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Very good answer.

120
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Haven't I told you?

121
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:13,000
In these I have sent a new species to the botanical society.

122
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Previously unknown.

123
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Or so?

124
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,000
No one has found it before.

125
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:23,000
It is a wild rare palm.

126
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Or have you sent a new species to the botanical society?

127
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
It's me.

128
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:33,000
It would be a greater honor if you named it Hemulensis.

129
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
This is Hemuli Formis.

130
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Certainly.

131
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:41,000
That's why I've been spending sleepless nights on them lately.

132
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
I see.

133
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,000
The answer should have arrived ages ago.

134
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Where the hell does it stay?

135
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Maybe the jury can't decide.

136
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Should it be called Hemulensis or Hemuli Formis?

137
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
What now?

138
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Aha.

139
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Now I understand.

140
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:05,000
There is no answer because I haven't found a new species.

141
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Of course not.

142
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Someone already found it.

143
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Don't sleep.

144
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:20,000
What a fool are you, a catty man's career tag?

145
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Hemuli, calm down.

146
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:28,000
You can call me Mr. Hemulensis.

147
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Listen now, Hemuli.

148
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:35,000
The answer will be delayed because the plant must be examined very carefully.

149
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:40,000
All source works must first be browsed in order to draw scientific conclusions.

150
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Would that really be the case?

151
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Does the research take that long?

152
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Of course it will last.

153
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
When did you send the sample?

154
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
A month ago.

155
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Trust your abilities, Hemuli.

156
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
It is neither time nor nothing.

157
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Trust itself is everything.

158
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Excellent. Everything is fine now.

159
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Great news, Mom.

160
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Hemuli has invented a completely new plant and its name will be Hemulensis.

161
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,000
That's great.

162
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Good luck, Hemuli, honey.

163
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Well, the cardboard is missing.

164
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Don't be needlessly modest about it.

165
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,000
We have to organize cookies in Hemul's honor.

166
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Really.

167
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
When? Today or tomorrow?

168
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:36,000
There is no such rush.

169
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Why not?

170
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Hemuli.

171
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
So?

172
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Does the plant you found have flowers?

173
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Everyone has it.

174
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Are they beautiful?

175
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Very beautiful. Just as beautiful as the old lady.

176
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Oh, thank you.

177
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Muikkunen, let's go find out about those jerks tonight.

178
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Most of all.

179
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Do you need me as a guide?

180
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Do you want to join?

181
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
It's to be heard.

182
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Bangs come late at night.

183
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
I don't go to sleep at all.

184
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
What do you think?

185
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Sell or does he decide not to convert at all?

186
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Phooey.

187
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Remember to be careful sell. This can be a dangerous sell.

188
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Of course it is. I guess I wouldn't have ruined my night's sleep otherwise.

189
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Stick to kinder.

190
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Remember.

191
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:29,000
I was at the beach last night at the same time when the witch was flying there on her broom.

192
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:33,000
I couldn't detect anything out of the ordinary.

193
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Were you? Why didn't you take me with you?

194
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,000
You are so big and white.

195
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:43,000
I'm not big and I'm not white.

196
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,000
I'm not big and I'm not white.

197
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
There's someone over there.

198
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,000
It's Alice. Hi Alisa.

199
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Alisa hi.

200
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Well hello.

201
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Bye bye.

202
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Hold the towel.

203
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Did you come here to play?

204
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,000
We have other things in mind. More important.

205
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Listen.

206
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
What?

207
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Has your grandma been nice to you in the last few weeks?

208
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Of course it is. Nice as pie.

209
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,000
When I stopped going to Moominvalley.

210
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Well, that's great.

211
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Yeah. I better keep my promise.

212
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
At least for a while.

213
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
What are these?

214
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Herbs. Necessary for a witch.

215
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:34,000
As well as the stomachs of frogs and the tails of groundhogs.

216
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Hmmm. Just licorice.

217
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
It is.

218
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Well it is. Good snuff, little one.

219
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Helps with heart disease and cough.

220
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
That's great.

221
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,000
And it also makes cows go belly up.

222
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Don't be shy, Alisa.

223
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Um.

224
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Ooo.

225
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Maybe an answer.

226
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Good day. Aren't you a wonderful air?

227
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Good day, Hemuli.

228
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,000
You work hard every day.

229
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
I guess so.

230
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Wait a minute.

231
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Well, what do you want?

232
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,000
A letter. I want my letter.

233
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
It wasn't.

234
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Yes, but when it wasn't yesterday. And not the other day either.

235
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,000
No one has written you a book.

236
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,000
But I should have received a letter.

237
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Are you absolutely sure that it's not in some pocket of the bag?

238
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,000
even then, there would be no book for me.

239
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Please take a look.

240
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
The ice melts. See for yourself.

241
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
In.

242
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Well, if you don't seem to believe otherwise, check it out.

243
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Try it all out.

244
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
No, yes I believe, but...

245
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Well, let's just be quick.

246
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,000
I don't think your soul park will find peace otherwise.

247
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Come on, that...

248
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Oops. He has a lot of letters today.

249
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:16,000
I really should get a better salary.

250
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Abdominal strain.

251
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:25,000
I could go and get something for the rest of us.

252
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,000
It makes me tired. I think I'll doze off.

253
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Can't collide.

254
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Sorry. I didn't see you.

255
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,000
You didn't see, although there is nothing else to see here.

256
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Sorry.

257
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Strange. What's wrong with you?

258
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Is this a Moomin trap?

259
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
There is. Of course.

260
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Finally. I thought I would never get here.

261
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Excuse me, but are you sick?

262
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Miss.

263
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Get up.

264
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,000
He has a terribly high fever.

265
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Let me be.

266
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:17,000
You can't stay lying here. You need to be put to bed.

267
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Do you happen to know hemul?

268
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Of course. Have you come to see the hemuli?

269
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Doesn't hemulia live here in Moomin Valley?

270
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Yeah, he lives close by.

271
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Great. I need to meet him.

272
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Hey, don't get dizzy again!

273
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Hey, help! Help is needed here!

274
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Oh heaven!

275
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Help! Hey, help! Help!

276
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Father! Father!

277
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Moominpappa is upstairs in the guest room with mom.

278
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Or so?

279
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
I just saved one girl.

280
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
A girl?

281
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Did you save?

282
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:14,000
A beautiful girl who is sick. I put her on the bed.

283
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
I want to see!

284
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
So do I.

285
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:22,000
I could take a look again.

286
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,000
First you have to get the fever down.

287
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
First you have to get the fever down.

288
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
I guess so.

289
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Fuck it.

290
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Nipsu told about the girl. Is he still sleeping?

291
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Joo.

292
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Where did it come from?

293
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:44,000
We don't know, but Nipsu said he came as Hemul's guest.

294
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Yes, and Niiskunnemi went to get hemul.

295
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Isn't it cute?

296
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
It's like a flower.

297
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
What did the witch tell you?

298
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Do I have to live somewhere?

299
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Must. You have received a young girl as a guest.

300
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,000
By the way, you give them medicine.

301
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
I don't know any young girl.

302
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Run, don't panic.

303
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:16,000
I said I don't know him.

304
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
If he has grown?

305
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:22,000
I have never known young girls in my life to which I said.

306
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Then why has he come to see you?

307
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Well, he's obviously a herbalist.

308
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
And has heard of me.

309
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Joo.

310
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
Goodness.

311
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Well, he'll tell you when he wakes up.

312
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Let's wait for grandma's medicine to work.

313
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
I think I'll go home.

314
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,000
No, you can't leave like that.

315
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
It's up to you.

316
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,000
No thanks, I have to compress the tumor.

317
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Come on, you really don't know him?

318
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,000
I don't know young girls.

319
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
Good continuation.

320
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
I think he didn't forget the thuds.

321
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:09,000
I don't, we're going to track them down tonight.

322
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:12,000
I would come too, but...

323
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,000
I'll go with you, so where did you go?

324
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Are you going to sneak off to the beach in the middle of nowhere?

325
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
Yeah, and as soon as we hear the thumps,

326
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
we run up the headland in their direction.

327
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
And not so?

328
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
I would really like to go.

329
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
You guys are coming.

330
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,000
What restraints would you have now?

331
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:32,000
I have responsibilities at home.

332
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
What about Nipsu then?

333
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
I'm not leaving.

334
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:43,000
Yeah, but if the girl is...

335
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:50,000
Well, here's something to eat if you get hungry.

336
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
Oh, thanks mom.

337
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
Bit of a night bite, eh?

338
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,000
Get jealous.

339
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Dad, why don't you come along?

340
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:03,000
I'd love to come, but tonight I better stay home, huh?

341
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Necessarily.

342
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:08,000
What could I do here alone if the girl gets worse?

343
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
Me too.

344
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
Me too.

345
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
Me too.

346
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
I'm waiting.

347
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:28,000
I think we should eat sparingly, fin.

348
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
It could be a long night.

349
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
Are there going to be bumps?

350
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,000
In the end, don't take any more for me and give me a good night's sleep.

351
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:38,000
In the end, don't take any more for me and give me a good night's sleep.

352
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,000
In the end, don't take any more for me and give me a good night's sleep.

353
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
You can't take it anymore.

354
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:47,000
I can handle it. Muona's old ones like every three equal parts.

355
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:51,000
I think it would be fairer to divide the muona according to size.

356
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
Oh hey.

357
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
What was it?

358
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
Went from there. Now keep an eye out.

359
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
There.

360
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
What is it?

361
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
Oh!

362
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
Actual fireworks.

363
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
It came from the sea.

364
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
Someone is shooting fireworks.

365
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
There's a boat over there.

366
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
It finally has the Syylnen we were looking for.

367
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
No! Come to the beach!

368
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
Isn't that Hemuli?

369
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:10,000
No. Looks like Hemul, but much younger.

370
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:20,000
That's how the night hikers found out that the thumps that kept everyone awake were caused by fireworks.

371
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:27,000
But the creature that fired the firework rockets dissolved into the darkness of the night.

372
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
Thanks.
