1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,040
A pinch

2
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:24,320
Due to Voinen's excitement, Nipsu decided to stay and sleep in the Moomin house.

3
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:28,320
Luuskamuikkunen, as usual, retreated to the tent.

4
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:33,320
Do you remember what had happened?

5
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:39,320
A terrible rain followed the heavy rain and wind, and everything around the rain froze.

6
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:47,320
The horrors of the night were not over for Moomin.

7
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:53,320
Help! The rascal is splitting me up!

8
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:58,320
Don't come! Leave me alone!

9
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:26,320
Huh? Why is laju on the floor?

10
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:28,320
Ah, a pinch!

11
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:39,320
Good morning, mom!

12
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:42,320
Good morning! Has Nipsu woke up?

13
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:45,320
Not on your life. Where are they?

14
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:49,320
It's still in the room. Those polos!

15
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:52,320
Does dad still drag the gallows?

16
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:54,320
No. Dad is in the yard.

17
00:01:57,320 --> 00:01:59,320
Dad, what are you doing?

18
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:01,320
The roses are dead.

19
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:03,320
So what too?

20
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:06,320
These are the old man's actions from yesterday.

21
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:15,320
The ground froze around the tree, but I didn't think the flowers would freeze.

22
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:19,320
Oh, if only we could have gotten a skunk in the ice cellar.

23
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:23,320
I have a dream that a skunk was chasing me.

24
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:28,320
Don't you mourn. I think the mörkö is looking for a breeze and a breeze.

25
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:31,320
At least they don't run away with the law?

26
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:34,320
Even that could be more favorable than them.

27
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:44,320
Don't the wind and the wind come down?

28
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:47,320
They would like breakfast in the room.

29
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:52,320
What did they tell? Why is the evil bastard chasing them?

30
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:57,320
They didn't tell. They just looked terrified.

31
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:00,320
We need to find out.

32
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:08,320
Moominma brings them breakfast and their secret is revealed.

33
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:18,320
Who for it?

34
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:21,320
Just me. I brought you breakfast.

35
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:26,320
You can come.

36
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:29,320
Well, what did they tell you?

37
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:33,320
Mörkö seems to be chasing the suitcase and not them.

38
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:37,320
What are those lilliputians hiding in their suitcases?

39
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:39,320
They have been great.

40
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:41,320
What is it?

41
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:43,320
They have been great.

42
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:45,320
They have been great.

43
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:47,320
They have been great.

44
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:49,320
They have been great.

45
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:51,320
They have been great.

46
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:53,320
They have been great.

47
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:55,320
They have been great.

48
00:03:57,320 --> 00:04:00,320
And the suitcase again seems to have belonged to the grunt before.

49
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:03,320
Have they stolen it?

50
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:08,320
It didn't become clear. They were very changeable.

51
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:10,320
This is going too far.

52
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:15,320
For example, if we were to trap dangerous criminals in our homes.

53
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:18,320
Let's ask the grump!

54
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:20,320
I won't even hear it.

55
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:24,320
We don't want to mess around back here. Or what?

56
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:26,320
We ask that the police ask the scumbag.

57
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:29,320
Don't get the police involved in this.

58
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:31,320
What should we do?

59
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:33,320
Don't you Shout at it!

60
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:40,320
Wait for their tongues to heat up.

61
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:47,320
If you pretend to be unlikable, they will reveal their secret in no time.

62
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:51,320
They didn't tell the father anything, the mother a little.

63
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:56,320
We need a woman, but I prefer a tighter and fancier age group.

64
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:58,320
Yes, of course.

65
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:05,320
Waste away!

66
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:07,320
Where is the trip?

67
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:08,320
Moomin house.

68
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:09,320
I'll come with you to the village.

69
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:11,320
I think you are there.

70
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:13,320
Not anymore. My sister came home yesterday.

71
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:16,320
Well, what about him?

72
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:18,320
He commands and snores.

73
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:19,320
Hey.

74
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:20,320
Hey.

75
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,320
Where are you going?

76
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:24,320
To meet you.

77
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:27,320
And I will come to see you.

78
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:29,320
And me?

79
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:31,320
I would otherwise be a gift.

80
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:33,320
Oh, a gift?

81
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:35,320
Yes, and it is very beautiful.

82
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:36,320
What is it?

83
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:38,320
You can't break it and you can't lose it.

84
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:39,320
Of course not.

85
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:41,320
Please.

86
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:43,320
Thanks.

87
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:44,320
Open it.

88
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:47,320
Oh, how beautiful I look.

89
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:51,320
I broke into them on the beach because of you.

90
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:53,320
Look, you can mirror it.

91
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:55,320
True.

92
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:56,320
Oh, thank you.

93
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:59,320
I give my heart to you.

94
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:01,320
I cherish it.

95
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:04,320
My eyes always remind me of you.

96
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:05,320
Oh my, Peikka.

97
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:08,320
I'll let you see.

98
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:09,320
Thanks.

99
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:11,320
Thanks.

100
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:12,320
Oh my, Peikka.

101
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:17,320
I always give my baby a kiss before I go to rest.

102
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:21,320
It's going to be expensive.

103
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:24,320
Besides me.

104
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:28,320
So I should go for a walk with the tweezer and the fan.

105
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:31,320
Yeah, and don't bother them at all.

106
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:33,320
They get to cry on my shoulder.

107
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:35,320
They should be made to talk.

108
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:39,320
I feel important and nervous.

109
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:41,320
This is where you get tea.

110
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:42,320
Thanks.

111
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:55,320
Sell, you are not needed.

112
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:59,320
I forced out their secrets, even if by force.

113
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:01,320
We're not undercover cops.

114
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:03,320
We only talk to them.

115
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:04,320
And you're hiding secrets.

116
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:06,320
I'll keep quiet.

117
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:09,320
Have you ever tried to be quiet?

118
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:12,320
Maybe not.

119
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:14,320
Should try sometime.

120
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:16,320
I'll come with Niiskunneid.

121
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:19,320
A gentle and understanding woman is needed here.

122
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:21,320
It's me.

123
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:23,320
A nut in the shell.

124
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:24,320
Are you ready?

125
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:25,320
I don't.

126
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:28,320
There's a Moomin here.

127
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:30,320
I have a matter.

128
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:33,320
Hey.

129
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:36,320
Here is the swamp lady.

130
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:38,320
A gentle and understanding girl.

131
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:39,320
Hello.

132
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:41,320
Nice to meet you and your friends.

133
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:44,320
Niiskuneiti wants to talk to you.

134
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:46,320
Will you let him in?

135
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:51,320
Well, if he necessarily wants to.

136
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:53,320
Come on then.

137
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:54,320
Come on then.

138
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:06,320
Exactly heart shaped and so beautiful.

139
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:09,320
I've never seen anything like this.

140
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:11,320
Do you want the same?

141
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:12,320
In.

142
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:15,320
There is only one such pair of shoes.

143
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:17,320
Keep it in your handbag.

144
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:24,320
Ah.

145
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:26,320
I'm snuffling.

146
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:29,320
Niiskunneiti will surely succeed.

147
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:30,320
So.

148
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:33,320
They kind of seemed to like the marshmallows.

149
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:37,320
I'll feel the chills in my bones tonight.

150
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:38,320
You are right.

151
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:41,320
If only we could find out why the morko is chasing them.

152
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:46,320
If that monster comes every night, mom will lose all her flowers.

153
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:47,320
Look.

154
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:50,320
Uh.

155
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:55,320
They go out.

156
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:56,320
Good.

157
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:57,320
Good.

158
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:03,320
Myy!

159
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:10,320
We have to stop Myy before he ruins everything.

160
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:18,320
I'll never forgive you if it got in the way.

161
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:20,320
Don't get involved in this.

162
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:23,320
Let Niiskunneid handle this matter.

163
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:26,320
I'm just covering for them.

164
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:34,320
Niiskunnemi would take them for a walk.

165
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:36,320
Where are they now?

166
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:44,320
I can't hear a word of their speech.

167
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:45,320
Me neither.

168
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:47,320
We need to get closer.

169
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:49,320
Then they notice us.

170
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:55,320
I'm the only one small enough to get close enough.

171
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:56,320
Don't go.

172
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:58,320
You're making Niiskunneidi nervous.

173
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:00,320
You make him nervous.

174
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:01,320
Shhh.

175
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:02,320
Now.

176
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:05,320
Can I ask one more question?

177
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:06,320
Moment.

178
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:10,320
Is that suitcase yours or someone else's?

179
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:12,320
That's it.

180
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,320
Is it?

181
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:17,320
Well, I'll try again.

182
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:19,320
Whose suitcase is that?

183
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:20,320
It's ours.

184
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:26,320
But for the last time, you said that the suitcase is grubby.

185
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:28,320
On, on.

186
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:34,320
Can I ask the same thing again?

187
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:36,320
That's all.

188
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:38,320
More about that suitcase.

189
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:40,320
How is it?

190
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:42,320
Do you own a suitcase?

191
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:43,320
Emme.

192
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:44,320
We own.

193
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:50,320
Don't give them anything else, that's what Pekka said.

194
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:53,320
What happened to you?

195
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:57,320
Excuse me now, but may I ask one more time?

196
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:59,320
As many times as you want.

197
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:01,320
Oh thank you.

198
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:02,320
I'll ask for the last time.

199
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:04,320
Please answer honestly.

200
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:09,320
That suitcase?

201
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:10,320
So.

202
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:11,320
Which one do you have?

203
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:12,320
So.

204
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:14,320
Is it yours?

205
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:15,320
On.

206
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:17,320
So it's not a moron?

207
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:19,320
No, it's not curmudgeonly.

208
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:20,320
Ehdankin.

209
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:22,320
Thanks and praise, please.

210
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:25,320
Thanks and praise, please.

211
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:27,320
Niiskunneiti had a hard time.

212
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:31,320
I would have said shit and he would have spilled his secret.

213
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:33,320
I'm sure of that.

214
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:35,320
Niiskunnetti is nice.

215
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:39,320
All other Mitalo residents are nice.

216
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:42,320
Do you think they would want to keep us forever?

217
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:45,320
Of course, if we can get through the mess.

218
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:48,320
Yes, if we can get through it.

219
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:52,320
I won their trust and now we are good friends.

220
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:54,320
Who wouldn't be your friend.

221
00:11:56,320 --> 00:12:00,320
Thank you, even though it wasn't easy.

222
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:02,320
They mess things up.

223
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:06,320
I feel like I'm the only one who doesn't mess up.

224
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:09,320
I didn't find out much.

225
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:11,320
I should have been put on the case.

226
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:15,320
Niiskunnie, what did you find out then?

227
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:21,320
Well, first of all, the suitcase seems to belong to them.

228
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:22,320
So how are you?

229
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:24,320
Don't jump!

230
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:29,320
The contents of the suitcase, on the other hand, belong to mörö.

231
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:33,320
Well, it's a good time, it's a complicated thing.

232
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:35,320
Hi, what's in the suitcase?

233
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:37,320
That's what they say.

234
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:41,320
Only that it is the most beautiful in the world.

235
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:42,320
Under the sun?

236
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:44,320
Oh the most beautiful?

237
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:48,320
Ah, this is very confusing.

238
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:51,320
They don't look like thieves after all.

239
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:55,320
Yes, however, we have to drive away the mud.

240
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:59,320
I don't understand how a moron can own the most beautiful thing in the world.

241
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:06,320
Tiuhti and viuhti told me that Mörkö just happens to own it.

242
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:10,320
Mörkö himself could have stolen the contents of the suitcase.

243
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:12,320
Good unusual.

244
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:17,320
Tiuhti and fanuhith are terribly afraid of the revenge of the grunt.

245
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:21,320
But they are still not going to give up the contents of the suitcase.

246
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:24,320
Pretty cool.

247
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:27,320
There will be a storm tonight for sure.

248
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:30,320
What are we doing?

249
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:32,320
Same as last night.

250
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:38,320
If the contents of the suitcase belong to a moron, we can't just drive it away.

251
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:42,320
It's unlikely that a moron will agree to leave so easily.

252
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:47,320
If it stays, we may have an eternal winter.

253
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:50,320
I cover the petunias just in case.

254
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:52,320
Are you leaving here?

255
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:53,320
I'm going downhill.

256
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:55,320
I'm going home.

257
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:57,320
But Muikkunen's snuff remains.

258
00:13:57,320 --> 00:14:00,320
Now don't look so gloomy.

259
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:03,320
I have a plan.

260
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:07,320
What kind?

261
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:10,320
Just one. Then you'll see.

262
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:14,320
Good.

263
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:25,320
Good.

264
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:55,320
Good.

265
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:57,320
Good.

266
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:24,320
It's going to be bad. It's already close.

267
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:27,320
Maybe something else will clear it up.

268
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:29,320
It's your turn to sell.

269
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:34,320
I know, I know. If you don't have a cross ace.

270
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:36,320
Now the rain is coming.

271
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:38,320
Just when you were winning.

272
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:41,320
Go under the table. This can get dangerous.

273
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:44,320
Crazy. How can you hit with a rolling pin from under the table?

274
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:56,320
Is Mörko here?

275
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:58,320
Yeah. In the same place as yesterday.

276
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:00,320
I went flat on the ground on its toes.

277
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:04,320
I'll go first. The rest of you stay behind me.

278
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:06,320
Moomin mom.

279
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:08,320
Yes, my darling.

280
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:11,320
You said you had a plan.

281
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:14,320
Isn't it about time?

282
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:29,320
Listen, Morkö. We want to talk to you.

283
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:33,320
We know you have come to claim your property,

284
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:37,320
whose dense breezes have been usurped from you.

285
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:40,320
Isn't that the case?

286
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:43,320
Did you sell the property to them?

287
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:48,320
Or would you give it for free?

288
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:53,320
I have beautiful things in my handbag.

289
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:56,320
Shall we trade?

290
00:17:05,320 --> 00:17:08,320
How about this pendant?

291
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:14,320
Oh.

292
00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:18,320
Oh, Don't you like it?

293
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:21,320
How about this?

294
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:25,320
Or this?

295
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:34,320
Nothing works for you?

296
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:39,320
You can get anything from my handbag, except aspirins.

297
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:48,320
Is this what you mean?

298
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:57,320
Or this?

299
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:02,320
Well, for once, it's not really for me.

300
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:06,320
Moomin, can I give you a shoe?

301
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:10,320
Ai!

302
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:12,320
You can't really.

303
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:14,320
Mom, it didn't hurt.

304
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:17,320
No, my hand just suddenly froze.

305
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:24,320
Now that you've got this shoe approved, you'll never go back.

306
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:31,320
Dare, Lapas to come back!

307
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:46,320
Oh, you missed it.

308
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:49,320
Moominma had sense.

309
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:51,320
Thanks, mom.

310
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:56,320
Anna, sorry Moomin.

311
00:18:56,320 --> 00:19:00,320
I didn't remember that your shoe was from my handbag too.

312
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:03,320
Uh, never mind, mom.

313
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:07,320
What does Niiskuneti think?

314
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:13,320
You promised to give this shoe a kiss every night, or something else friendly.

315
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:17,320
Mom did the right thing.

316
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:20,320
Besides, I'm not going to tell niiskuned.

317
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:24,320
That's where the truth always comes out.

318
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:27,320
From now on I will always tell the truth.

319
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:40,320
Moomin, look, I found one!

320
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:47,320
Very similar but mine was much bigger.

321
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:50,320
Oh, was it much bigger?

322
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:56,320
Moomin had to find a shoe that was exactly like the one Niiskunnet gave him.

323
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:11,320
Here it is, here it is, I found it!

324
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:17,320
Look, this is pretty much the same.

325
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:24,320
It was a miracle, but miracles do happen in Moomin Valley.
