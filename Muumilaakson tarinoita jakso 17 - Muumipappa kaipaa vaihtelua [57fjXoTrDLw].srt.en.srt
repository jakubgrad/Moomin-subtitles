00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:30,000
This year let's see next let's see next let's see next let's see next let's see next let's see next let's see next let's see next let's see next let's see next let's see next let's see next let's see next let's see next let's see next let's see next let's see next let's see next let's see next

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Moomin valley bathed in the sunshine again, lazy and relaxed.

3
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
But that's not to everyone's liking.

4
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Inside.

5
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Honey, Would you like a cup of coffee?

6
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
My insides are literally screaming for coffee.

7
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Oh well, it's time.

8
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Memoirs huh?

9
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Writing sucks.

10
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
How could you write in this dormant cheap?

11
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
How so?

12
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
The dull phase of my youth is passing.

13
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Goodness.

14
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
You are exaggerating.

15
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I wrote poetry.

16
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Your poems must have been good.

17
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Terrible.

18
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:21,000
But my duty to posterity requires me to record everything, the inspiration is just lacking.

19
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
How would inspiration be possible when nothing ever happens here?

20
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Good unusual. Do you miss adventures?

21
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,000
I miss you. I miss something big, something scary.

22
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Hey mom, what's up now?

23
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Your father craves adventure.

24
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:50,000
His writing is floundering again because everything is so boring.

25
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
And nothing ever happens to him.

26
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Is Moominpappa missing something really exciting?

27
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Yes, I think so.

28
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Maybe I can organize something exciting.

29
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Now it looks like the footprints of a huge monster.

30
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Hey, hey, hey.

31
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Oh, that it will be good luck for me when I can bring joy to others.

32
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
A few more tracks.

33
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Fortunately, I don't often have to do honest work.

34
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Oh, rougher than I imagined.

35
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Back, back, back.

36
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Wake up, Moomin, wake up.

37
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Hooi, Moominmamma, Moominpapa, get up.

38
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Awakening, awakening, monster.

39
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
A monster has happened to you.

40
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Awakening, awakening, monster.

41
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
A monster has happened to you.

42
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Come quickly before you are eaten alive. Come already.

43
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Huge footprints.

44
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,000
I succeeded, leaving a mark in my heart.

45
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
A monster from the unexplored depths.

46
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Very strange. What business would a monster have in a Moomin house?

47
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
I don't know.

48
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
The footprints lead straight to the Moomin house.

49
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Someone has told the monster where our house is.

50
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:43,000
But have you noticed that monster tracks don't lead back?

51
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,000
In that case, the monster is still here.

52
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:52,000
If the monster has retraced its tracks, it must be pretty smart.

53
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,000
And it has stepped very precisely in its old tracks.

54
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,000
There's only one here, but why would it have done that?

55
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Of course, it's also possible that the monster is still here.

56
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Cat containers, my mother would say.

57
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Why does the monster want to believe that it has gone away?

58
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
It's furrows.

59
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Furrows?

60
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
What does furrows do?

61
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Something secret.

62
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:21,000
If we knew what, even the monster would be a good furrow.

63
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,000
I think the monster is still here. Or what?

64
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Tonight maybe.

65
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
What? What tonight?

66
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
We are being attacked.

67
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
The monster has gone to report his information.

68
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Dad, how do you know?

69
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,000
That's why he's trying to make you believe it's still here.

70
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Mother! Mother!

71
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
What's wrong, Moomin?

72
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Terrible things happen.

73
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000
The monster attacks first and us.

74
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
And dad is so excited about it.

75
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Oh, I'm happy for papa.

76
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Work diligently.

77
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
The monster will be here next night.

78
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Pull!

79
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Well, now it's up.

80
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Father, wildly high authenticity.

81
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
It is, but it may still be too low.

82
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,000
They are so gullible that they almost spoil my joy.

83
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:27,000
If we catch a moose, we sell it to a zoo.

84
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
And I can do business.

85
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,000
I want to tame a monster as my pet.

86
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Well, the monster could be harnessed as an attraction.

87
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,000
I invented selling the monster to the zoo.

88
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,000
It's only fair that I get half the price.

89
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,000
That the monster could polski, huh?

90
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Splashing in the water keeps it calm.

91
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
I'm a monster.

92
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
I'm a monster.

93
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
I'm a monster.

94
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
I'm a monster.

95
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
I'm a monster.

96
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
I'm a monster.

97
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
I'm a monster.

98
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
I'm a monster.

99
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
I'm a monster.

100
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
I'm a monster.

101
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
I'm a monster.

102
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
I'm a monster.

103
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
I'm a monster.

104
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
I'm a monster.

105
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
I'm a monster.

106
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
I'm a monster.

107
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
I'm a monster.

108
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
I'm a monster.

109
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
I'm a monster.

110
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
I'm a monster.

111
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
I'm a monster.

112
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
I'm a monster.

113
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
I'm a monster.

114
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,200
If the monster doesn't show up until the next night.

115
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:40,200
We share shifts.

116
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:46,200
The entire Moomin Valley is watching how we handle the duty that has fallen to us.

117
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Hey, oh. The trouble was worth it, oh, those crazy people.

118
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Oops, they've put food as bait.

119
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Moomipappa seems overworked.

120
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,000
He snores so hard the house shakes.

121
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
I'll take these treats.

122
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Oh, what's going on here.

123
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,000
They've dug in here, it's full of water and...

124
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Opsist.

125
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Oh, what was that.

126
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,000
The monster is here, the gate is closed.

127
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
No, no.

128
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Oh, the rope had to be pulled.

129
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Intelligence.

130
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Let's stop.

131
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
It's just me.

132
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Oh, from dad, unit bite.

133
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Oh, where's the monster?

134
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:10,000
I'm just here, I stink, and I'm not a monster.

135
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
ha Isu Li.

136
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Speak up.

137
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Beware, it is a dangerous monster.

138
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Look, I'm not a monster, I made those footprints.

139
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Oh you.

140
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,000
False, your feet don't make that big of a mark.

141
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Don't skimp.

142
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Moomin papa.

143
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
I'm snuffling.

144
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Why don't you let the skunk go, it's a skunk.

145
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Is it?

146
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Stink, skunk, and he made those footprints.

147
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,000
How do you know that?

148
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:47,000
I happened to be in trouble at the beach late last night.

149
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,000
And I saw him creeping here.

150
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
ha Isu Li.

151
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Why don't you come in, Stinkbug?

152
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
I'm fine here.

153
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
You were kind to make the footprints.

154
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,000
It's been so exciting for Papa.

155
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,000
But yes, I was able to work hard.

156
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Making Onna's hooks is not easy.

157
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,000
You said that I'm yummy.

158
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Dad, where are you going?

159
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Not much anywhere.

160
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
What?

161
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Mamma.

162
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
What now, papa?

163
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
I'll tell you a secret.

164
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Should I sit down first?

165
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
I have made a firm decision.

166
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Of course.

167
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,000
I'm running away on an adventure.

168
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Are you going far?

169
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:21,000
It is a journey without a goal, full of setbacks and dangers.

170
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
And you come along.

171
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Are all the children included or just the Moomin?

172
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
No children.

173
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
It wouldn't be an unusual life at all.

174
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
I'm thinking of running away.

175
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
I've always wanted to escape.

176
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:40,000
I will once again become the adventurer I was in my turbulent youth.

177
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:45,000
And when you're by our side, we'll experience romance and everything.

178
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,000
But what if Moomin gets angry?

179
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
And don't get angry.

180
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Besides, it would be time for Moomin to gradually learn to take care of himself.

181
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,000
And grow into a man.

182
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Come on mom.

183
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Oh papa, wait.

184
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,000
We can't take any more stuff with us.

185
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:19,000
No no, but I forgot to leave a note where the sugar is.

186
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Children can survive without sugar if they can't find it.

187
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:29,000
But then they can't bake crackers and the theme is terrible.

188
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:32,000
And they can't find cinnamon in the eternal world?

189
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Those women, I wish we had gone alone.

190
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Now let's think about cinnamon, when the familiar is calling.

191
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:43,000
An adventure isn't worth much if you can't tell from behind.

192
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Huh, that was a lifesaver.

193
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Dad, what else?

194
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Nothing, let's go.

195
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
The day is dawning.

196
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Let's go.

197
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
We have a long way to go.

198
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:59,000
That's right, let's let the feet take us where they take us.

199
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:03,000
My legs say this way.

200
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Good morning, mom.

201
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Is mom still sleeping?

202
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
What is it?

203
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Father and mother are missing.

204
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Have you searched?

205
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
I am.

206
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
That's it then.

207
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,000
I'm starting to get hungry.

208
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
So do I.

209
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Don't cry, Goblin.

210
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:52,000
I'm pretty sure at least your mom will be back soon.

211
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,000
But where could they have gone?

212
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Well, I guess they left a message.

213
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Have you eaten yet?

214
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
I won't crumble.

215
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
I am alone.

216
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
The head can be a Moomin, Goblin.

217
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
You get these fish.

218
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:12,000
If you want, I'll come to the Moomin house to make them for you.

219
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Just thanks for the offer, Nuuska-muikkunen.

220
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:19,000
But there are already two enthusiastic cooks in the kitchen.

221
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,000
It's fun when you can try on your own.

222
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:26,000
If you give me a taste of my sorghum, I'll give you a taste of your bun.

223
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
It's fine.

224
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
I am alone.

225
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
I'll taste you in your ass.

226
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
It's fine.

227
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Which one are we in?

228
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
No idea.

229
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,000
It was dark everywhere.

230
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:46,000
The sun must have already risen. Why not get brighter?

231
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,000
From mamma, you see.

232
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:52,000
I'm afraid we're trapped.

233
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
What do you mean?

234
00:13:54,000 --> 00:14:01,000
It's just that we've wandered into a whole network of caves.

235
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Oh my, you burn it to the bottom.

236
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Mind your own business, if I'm going to stick to burnt food.

237
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:19,000
There can be nothing worse than your first soup.

238
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Phew, practice has made me an excellent cook.

239
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Where is Moomin lurking anyway?

240
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Moomin, whoa! Come and taste, come!

241
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Mother! Father!

242
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Huh?

243
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:41,000
What was that? Daddy, wake up!

244
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Hey!

245
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:04,000
This is brackish water. The sea can't be far.

246
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Huh?

247
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:39,000
A big fish.

248
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:46,000
I got you!

249
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Moomin, what are you doing so far from home?

250
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Daddy, look!

251
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:57,000
I caught a big fish. Mother, come quickly!

252
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:01,000
Don't let the fish get away.

253
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:09,000
I have never met such a big fish.

254
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:12,000
Me neither. Maybe dad will see.

255
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Yes, papa. This is a Moomin trap. Looks kind of familiar.

256
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,000
Of course. We are at the mouth of the cave.

257
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Eh, it could be prevented. I'm afraid your father cheated.

258
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,000
where is dad

259
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:31,000
That... Father went in search of adventures.

260
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Where did he go?

261
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,000
I don't know exactly somewhere.

262
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:41,000
I would have liked to go along. When will dad come back?

263
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:45,000
He didn't say anything. Maybe he will come home in the evening.

264
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:50,000
Or tomorrow, or next week, or Christmas. Who knows?

265
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:55,000
Dad is currently experiencing some wonderful adventure. That's right.

266
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:07,000
Mom! Hi, where are you?

267
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Mamma has disappeared.

268
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Mamma!

269
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:28,000
Mamma!

270
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,000
Mamma!

271
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,000
Mom answers!

272
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,000
Oh edible sea.

273
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,000
Now this just...

274
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:58,000
This is it.

275
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,000
God forbid.

276
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,000
Dad is back.

277
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:32,000
Hey, daddy's back home.

278
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:35,000
What? What? What?

279
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:38,000
Good morning dad!

280
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,000
I'm home again.

281
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:44,000
Welcome home.

282
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,000
Thank you mommy.

283
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:50,000
How did the adventure go?

284
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,000
Unexpectedly. That's exactly what I would say.

285
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:56,000
Is there food?

286
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,000
There is! I would taste my sarsel.

287
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:02,000
My food is a four-star delicacy.

288
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,000
I'm hungry.

289
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:08,000
Tell us about your adventure dad.

290
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:11,000
Sometimes repeated. Were you in mortal danger?

291
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:14,000
How to understand that now?

292
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:18,000
Tomorrow papa doesn't seem to be able to talk about his adventure right away.

293
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:24,000
That was the end of Papa Moomin and Mama Moomin's escape.
