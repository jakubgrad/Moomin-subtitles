1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:03,280
- They choose the right Pretty Pour...

2
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:14,040
â€“ Hmmm...

3
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,560
OikeMusik

4
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Ui.

5
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Isn't it a beautiful flower?

6
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
There is. What could it be called?

7
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
I don't know, you have to ask Hemur.

8
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Mamma Honey, it's your birthday soon.

9
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
I know.

10
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
I'm not thinking of a present for you now.

11
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Cheer up.

12
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
You deserve a fun gift, a special fun gift.

13
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Beautiful yard.

14
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Moominpapa had no idea what he would give Moominamma.

15
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
And it was only a week until my birthday.

16
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Oh my god, this is awful.

17
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Extra fun, funny and special.

18
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
A fun and special gift.

19
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
I shouldn't have said that.

20
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Wedding. And you don't want to give a gift?

21
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Of course I want to.

22
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:47,000
But when I went to promise a special fun gift, I can't give anything ordinary.

23
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,000
True. Mamma hardly wants a model airplane.

24
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,000
No. But would you invent something once you've invented it?

25
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
I'm thinking about it.

26
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Mom is coming.

27
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Hello Moomin.

28
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Hi Niisku, what were you talking about?

29
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Not much of anything, really.

30
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
We don't judge the weather.

31
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Well, I hope you came to that conclusion.

32
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Well, I hope you came to the conclusion that the sun is shining.

33
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Get out below watch out, I'm coming.

34
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,000
I must say that being small has its advantages.

35
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Yes, it never hurts to sell.

36
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Hello then Niisku.

37
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Hey.

38
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Now I figured it out. Birthday present.

39
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
What do you give?

40
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
A homemade bicycle.

41
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Good idea.

42
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Sorry to bother you, but would you have time to plan it?

43
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
And in a hurry.

44
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Right.

45
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
A heavy person should be able to handle it.

46
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
And go fast.

47
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Last year, daddy gave mommy a seashell necklace.

48
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Mom liked it a lot.

49
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
What about next year?

50
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
As I recall, mom got a hammock?

51
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
But it soon broke down.

52
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Mamma is pregnant.

53
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
What did mom get it last year?

54
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Hello, here we are this year.

55
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Oh right.

56
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Let's give Mommy Moomin a skateboard.

57
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,000
I share similar to this mine.

58
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
It doesn't suit mom.

59
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Of course not.

60
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Skateboarding is not very feminine.

61
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Mom can hurt herself.

62
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Would a nice hairbrush be fine?

63
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Mamma is bald.

64
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Let's give horribly tart filled candies.

65
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Nipsu, we know no one would eat.

66
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Coming up with a gift is difficult.

67
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Ah.

68
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
What now?

69
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Now I know.

70
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
You know what?

71
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Moomipapa has built something secret in Niisku's workshop.

72
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Probably a gift.

73
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
It can't be anything else.

74
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Let's hope so.

75
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
My wet brother helps him.

76
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
What can they do for mom with Askarre?

77
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Our gift has to be even better than mummy papas.

78
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,000
I think you should ask what mommy wants.

79
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
The bike meets my expectations.

80
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
I included a blue copy.

81
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
A really solid act.

82
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Mamma can easily get to things and get exercise.

83
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Shall I set off?

84
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Fuck off.

85
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Here's how it goes.

86
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
In the popes.

87
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Does it hurt badly?

88
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:06,000
No, but the bicycle went to pieces.

89
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Now you mustn't strain your leg.

90
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
And, and.

91
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
I came. Father.

92
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
What has happened?

93
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Father swatted the rock upside down.

94
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Mercy only, but can lead to blood poisoning.

95
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Mumimamma.

96
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
What Nipsu?

97
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,000
What would you like to get from us for your birthday?

98
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Something you have done yourself.

99
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Yeah, but what?

100
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Come on, I feel like the pan liners are starting to wear out again.

101
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Dad, do you already have a gift for mom?

102
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Kind of.

103
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
We haven't invented anything.

104
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Didn't mom say something about pans?

105
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Mom has some stashed in her cupboard. What do we do?

106
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Let's think, let's think.

107
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Listen mom.

108
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Wait, I'll take a little more time at the counters.

109
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Oh, dishes, work, work.

110
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Oh!

111
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Sorry, did you say something?

112
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,000
No, I'm fine, mom.

113
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
What happened to him?

114
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
That's a nut to crack.

115
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Remember.

116
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,000
That's a nut to crack.

117
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Remember, no swing necklace, roller skates or chocolate.

118
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Shut the fuck up. Muuska muikku, they are thinking now.

119
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Let's give flowers.

120
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Flower?

121
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
So.

122
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
It's not a proper gift.

123
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Chocolate is also a better option.

124
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Let's prevent a flower bed for Mamma Moomin.

125
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:56,000
It has germ. Mamma likes taking care of flowers.

126
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,000
I like the idea of mom getting her own flower bed.

127
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Good thing I asked Muikku.

128
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
I have no idea what you are building.

129
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Soon you will see.

130
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Looks like a water mill.

131
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Well, you can't go far wrong.

132
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Vesimylly.

133
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Sorry to keep you waiting.

134
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
What do you do on the plates?

135
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Pesenne. This is a water powered dishwasher.

136
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Good unusual.

137
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Doing dishes with this puller is pure joy.

138
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Do I put the dirty dishes in the grinder?

139
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Yeah, they're screwed in and then we sit and wait.

140
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Did you invent the tricks yourself?

141
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:58,000
I am and it works. Unlike your bicycle.

142
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:03,000
The bike was broken by the building, not because of a design flaw.

143
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Well, show me already.

144
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Starting.

145
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Let's see how the dirt comes off the plates automatically.

146
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Hmm.

147
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Ooo.

148
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Ooo.

149
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Hey.

150
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Ooo.

151
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Haha.

152
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
So yes.

153
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Moomin, Do you know where all the plates have gone?

154
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
No idea.

155
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Papa, have you seen our plates?

156
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Oh, he's sleeping.

157
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Something particularly fun.

158
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Less time wasted.

159
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Moominpappa had thought his head off.

160
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,000
But finally he got the idea.

161
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Ooo.

162
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Well, of course it's a good idea.

163
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Paper.

164
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Paper.

165
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Paper.

166
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Dad, here's some coffee.

167
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Oh, thank you.

168
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Mamma!

169
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
What now honey?

170
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Could you look at me for a moment?

171
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Like this?

172
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Excellent. I'm motionless.

173
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
I'm trying.

174
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Stay in that position, you must not move.

175
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,000
What the hell are you talking about?

176
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Thank you mom honey.

177
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Pappa is going to paint a portrait of Moomin with watercolors.

178
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Not a crazy idea at all.

179
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Maybe flowers for Moominamma's birthday.

180
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Of course. Take as much as you want.

181
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Thanks. We will immediately take a couple of boxes with us.

182
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
What's up?

183
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Hemuli!

184
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
So what?

185
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
What are these black flowers?

186
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Black roses.

187
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Roses?

188
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Aren't they beautiful?

189
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Unnatural to me.

190
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,000
We don't want those Moomin's gardens.

191
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Or so. But black accentuates other colors beautifully.

192
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Where were you going to plant the flowers.

193
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
We haven't decided.

194
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Somewhere next to a wall, I guess?

195
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:33,000
No. I suggest we plant the flowers somewhere further away.

196
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Mom deserves a surprise.

197
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Mom! Mom!

198
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
what's wrong my dear

199
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Do you know where my watercolors have gone?

200
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,000
I couldn't find them in the pyro box.

201
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
They drowned.

202
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Ai.

203
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Don't you remember last summer when we were at the beach?

204
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Oh yeah. I devoured them.

205
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,000
You had to get new watercolors.

206
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
I'm a fool.

207
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Se he Kerbera.

208
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Yeah, I feel.

209
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Do you know what flower it is?

210
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
I don't know.

211
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
If on Armory.

212
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Amrileria, sure.

213
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
If on Armory.

214
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
If on Armory.

215
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
If on Armory.

216
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
If on Armory.

217
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
If on Armory.

218
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Amrileria, sure.

219
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Don't mind the roots, little sell.

220
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Remember that flowers are alive.

221
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Oh.

222
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Mom's birthday is the day after tomorrow.

223
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:44,000
And I don't know anything as a gift.

224
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,000
If I just say I love him.

225
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:52,000
A particularly fun gift.

226
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Or at least funny or special.

227
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Hey.

228
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
There's dad over there.

229
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Isn't it?

230
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Well, it seems so.

231
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
What's wrong with him?

232
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Father!

233
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Father!

234
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
What is it?

235
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Did you get blood poisoning?

236
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
A Moomin?

237
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
And the snot nose?

238
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
A pinch?

239
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
So when it's sold right away?

240
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Habits are the number of flowers.

241
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
You don't pack.

242
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
In.

243
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:31,000
We will plant her own flower bed as a birthday gift.

244
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Make them a welcome gift.

245
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Is your present a ready-made Moomin doll?

246
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:40,000
What are you building for us mom?

247
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Nothing special.

248
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
I see.

249
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
You want to keep it a secret.

250
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Yeah, that's right.

251
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Shall we continue the journey?

252
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Let's continue.

253
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Dad, we're in a bit of a hurry.

254
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
So?

255
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Where do you take the flowers?

256
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:59,000
We hide them overnight and plant them tomorrow.

257
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
I can help if you want.

258
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Thanks dad.

259
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Nipsu, or tiring?

260
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Not guaranteed.

261
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:12,000
I estimate that we need you three more trips.

262
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Jukra, I'm getting hungry.

263
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Moomin troll?

264
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Yukra?

265
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Jukra, I'm getting hungry.

266
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Moomin troll?

267
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
What father?

268
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:35,000
That's it, all the three things I had thought of as a gift went to waste.

269
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Could I possibly be allowed to participate in your giveaway?

270
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
And I don't object.

271
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Well, neither do I.

272
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Yes, that's fine. We need help.

273
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,000
It's true, a pinch makes you lazy.

274
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:54,000
With papa's help, we created wonderful plantings for mom.

275
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Thank you for your trust, thank you.

276
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Stars, tomorrow will be a beautiful day.

277
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Must come.

278
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
What do you mean?

279
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Well, everyone likes beautiful weather.

280
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Not really you.

281
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,000
We can do it.

282
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Daddy, what's wrong with you?

283
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:30,000
No. Forget it, good night.

284
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Good night, papa.

285
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
At the foot of a cliff?

286
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Right.

287
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,000
But dad, isn't that pretty far?

288
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:46,000
I have a specific reason for planting the flowers there.

289
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Good morning.

290
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Where are the others?

291
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,000
The flowers are planted at the foot of the cliff.

292
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
It's so far.

293
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:03,000
I'll explain why we had to come all the way here.

294
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Whoa, wait a minute.

295
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
So what now?

296
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:12,000
I have forgotten one crucial point.

297
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Of course, blackberries don't exist.

298
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Oh my goodness.

299
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
Or black?

300
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Yeah, my whole idea goes to waste without blackberries.

301
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Are there any?

302
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,000
Is there?

303
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:30,000
No matter how many black roses there are in my garden.

304
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Don't, are you sure?

305
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Well, I am, but they are kind of sketchy.

306
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,000
You see they are not.

307
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:42,000
I solved my problem after all.

308
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,000
I don't want what you're after.

309
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Well, I'll explain to you.

310
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:51,000
We plant flowers at the foot of a cliff because...

311
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Can you guess what the reason is?

312
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,000
Good luck, let the voice be at school.

313
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Thank you, friends.

314
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:12,000
MÃ¤Ã¤tikulta, we have yet another birthday present for you.

315
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
Is there?

316
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:16,000
By us I mean everyone present.

317
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,000
Oh, I thank you all.

318
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Do you want to see the gift right away?

319
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Of course.

320
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
It doesn't even look like it's here.

321
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
We will take you to the gift.

322
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Aha, is it outside?

323
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
It's a long way to go.

324
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Come on, mom.

325
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:54,000
Mom, we're almost there now.

326
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,000
Mom, we're almost there now.

327
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
Oh, I'm getting nervous.

328
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
And all for me.

329
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,000
Joo.

330
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
Beautiful.

331
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
There are pets here.

332
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,000
So?

333
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Poppies, astles, cherubs.

334
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Moomin mamma looks pleased with her present.

335
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Even black flowers.

336
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,000
They are roses, difficult to cultivate.

337
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
I believe it.

338
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:38,000
Mamma, shall we climb up now?

339
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,000
Remind?

340
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,000
To the edge of the cliff.

341
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
Is there something there too?

342
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
Come after.

343
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
Is there something there too?

344
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,000
Come after.

345
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
What have you come up with?

346
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
You will soon see it.

347
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
Step on the edge.

348
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
Hey.

349
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
Do you like the view?

350
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
You still ask.

351
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,000
We planted the flowers according to the portrait drawn by father.

352
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:58,000
And we got a handbag from the black roses.

353
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:04,000
How can I thank you enough? What gift?

354
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
Just like you said, papa.

355
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
A particularly funny gift.

356
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
Day.

357
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
Day.
