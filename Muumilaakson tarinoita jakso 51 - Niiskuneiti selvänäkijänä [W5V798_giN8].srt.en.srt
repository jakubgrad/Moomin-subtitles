1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Before it starts to rain, we made it to the shelter of the tent.

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
While looking for new plants one day.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Hemuli crashed into the tent.

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
From the circus.

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Oh, what black clouds.

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Good thing we got to the shelter of the tent before it started raining.

7
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Joo.

8
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Good afternoon, Hemuli.

9
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Is that tent yours?

10
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Yes, I'm going to build my aircraft in it.

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Oh, so the drawings are ready and you've solved your problem.

12
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Kind of.

13
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Well, now what? You are usually more confident yourself.

14
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:57,000
My first flight was such an undercut to the bar that I'm now trying to stay in the lifts.

15
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I look forward to seeing your new aircraft.

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
The thunder is approaching, I keep going.

17
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I'm going home too.

18
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Uh, swim wretched.

19
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
So what now? What is it?

20
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
The tent is in the wrong place.

21
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
How so?

22
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
It should have been set up somewhere in the darkness of the forest.

23
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Here anyone can see it and find out if my new aircraft will fail too.

24
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Don't be a douchebag. Why does it fail?

25
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Why did it fail? I'm sure you were when we set up the tent.

26
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Yeah, but then the hemlu and who knows who else came up.

27
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Your aircraft will be a real smash hit. Exactly.

28
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
All right.

29
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:50,000
I'm going to work now. Come again in the middle of the night so you don't eat.

30
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Lovely.

31
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
I'm going to trot home now.

32
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:08,000
I swear my plane will fly.

33
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Oh, it started raining now.

34
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,000
It's not worth it. Wetting yourself can catch a cold.

35
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
It's not worth it. Wetting yourself can catch a cold.

36
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Isn't it because mother still hasn't woken up?

37
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
No.

38
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
It's time to go to Salaman.

39
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
That's what the snuffer said.

40
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Is he blue?

41
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
It doesn't look any different on the surface.

42
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
So I'll let you know.

43
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Father went to tell.

44
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
I brought you tea.

45
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Thanks mom.

46
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
So how did you eat?

47
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
It hasn't moved at all.

48
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Well, that's sad. He was sure he would have recovered from the blow by now.

49
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
He is so pale and motionless.

50
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Don't grieve.

51
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
What if he doesn't wake up until a hundred years from now?

52
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Are you awake?

53
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
I don't. I haven't bothered to disturb him.

54
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Repeat his name.

55
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
A lightning strike has made us deaf.

56
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
No gentle talk will probably work for him.

57
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
A wake-up call!

58
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
So mom, please wake up.

59
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
A little bit more.

60
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,000
You better wake up or I'll bite.

61
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Later on.

62
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
He says something.

63
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Now he wakes up.

64
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Well, mother.

65
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Jana. So when mom hears our voices.

66
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Luckily I didn't scream even louder when I woke him up.

67
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:05,000
I could have blown his brains out.

68
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Drink tea, so when you eat, you can open your eyes.

69
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
What has happened?

70
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,000
The snuffbox found you lying on the bed.

71
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Lightning had struck you.

72
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Snuff box.

73
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,000
So. He said that Lightning had knocked you to the ground.

74
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:37,000
I remember it was raining. It was raining really hard and then there was a loud bang.

75
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,000
So yes. You're crazy with shock right now.

76
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Oh, I have to thank Nuuskamuikkus.

77
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
He said he would go fishing when the rains stopped.

78
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Where was I going?

79
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
I don't know. Hardly far from his tent.

80
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Oh, he's gone elsewhere.

81
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,000
What now? Why are you staring?

82
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Where is it?

83
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
That...

84
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:05,000
You just said that Snuff has gone elsewhere.

85
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,000
It is. He's gone to far trouble.

86
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,000
You've been in a dreamland for hours. How do you know that?

87
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
I know because I see it.

88
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
I'm selling a roar.

89
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
What?

90
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:22,000
You roared so loudly that Niiskunead's sensitive mind was shaken.

91
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:27,000
I didn't really have much luck when Lightning hit him.

92
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Don't be a jerk. There is nothing wrong with Niiskunead.

93
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:35,000
He has just had a dream and is not quite awake yet.

94
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,000
I assure you that I am fully awake.

95
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,000
You are, but stay in bed for a while longer.

96
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Obey the head pillow.

97
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
I'll sing you lullabies.

98
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Sell, don't bother.

99
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
I sing if I want.

100
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Well, now what?

101
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Snuff-muikkunen.

102
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
What about snuff?

103
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:59,000
I have to hurry if I'm going to save him. I have to, I have to, I have to.

104
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Moist way.

105
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
I'm still waiting.

106
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Wet!

107
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Sell, see.

108
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Snuff-mum, come out.

109
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Away!

110
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:26,000
What if Niiskuneiti really knows something about snuff?

111
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Niiskuneni, where is Nuuskamuikkunen?

112
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Straight ahead. Still a little way to go.

113
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
what is Kimis was dangerous.

114
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Well, we'll find out when we get there.

115
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Niiskunmi, what are you trying to do?

116
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,000
I'm going to save Nuuska-muikkusen.

117
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,000
How do you know he's here?

118
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
I just know.

119
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Oh, look. There.

120
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
That's where Nuuska-muikkunen is.

121
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Right on Rokos.

122
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Look further.

123
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
I made a steep climb to the top.

124
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
He's hardworking in his way.

125
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,000
What do we do now? Do you want to roll?

126
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Wake up, Snuff-mug, wake up.

127
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
He can't hear us.

128
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
You don't know what my voice is capable of.

129
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Snuff-mum, wake up.

130
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Snuff-mum, wake up.

131
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Snuff-mum, wake up.

132
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Snuff-mum, wake up.

133
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
There's a swamp lady.

134
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
He has survived the lightning strike.

135
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Get out of there, snuff-guy.

136
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
What matter?

137
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Watch out, Snuska-muikkunen.

138
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Hurry away, Snuff-mug.

139
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Tel!

140
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Thank God that Niiskunnie wasn't injured after all.

141
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Physically, he is fine.

142
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Spatially?

143
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:12,000
He rushed his way to claim that Snuff-muikkunen is in danger.

144
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,600
I don't think I understand.

145
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:18,800
Niisku-neiti therefore foresees what will happen.

146
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:23,800
I was thinking about snuff and then suddenly I saw him on the fishing rod and...

147
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:27,000
...I knew something terrible was going to happen to him soon.

148
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,800
You are a clear seer.

149
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,200
Do you really think so?

150
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:33,400
My roar made him a clairvoyant!

151
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:35,200
Salaman, take a bath!

152
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:36,400
So sure.

153
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:41,200
Although I've never heard that Lightning could affect that way.

154
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:43,400
Niisku-neiti is a special case.

155
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:45,200
I don't really know what to do now.

156
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:54,000
So you really did see a snuffbox fishing, and it wasn't a dream.

157
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
I was awake.

158
00:08:55,000 --> 00:09:00,800
But wouldn't you think it was just some miraculous coincidence?

159
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:03,400
Well, what can I do about it?

160
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:04,400
I saw what I saw!

161
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:09,400
In that case, maybe you could tell me if your aircraft will succeed or not.

162
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:12,600
Let's see if I can try?

163
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:15,600
Absurd.

164
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:21,000
I'm a scientist and I shouldn't believe in anything unscientific.

165
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,800
You don't have to believe, but I'm a clear seer regardless.

166
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,600
hey what are you doing

167
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:31,800
I'll try to see if your new aircraft works out.

168
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:33,800
Niisku-neiti, stop!

169
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:34,800
Why?

170
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:38,600
You don't get to predict a recession if I know my plane is going to fail.

171
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:40,800
Well, you don't believe in this.

172
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,800
I don't think so, but...

173
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:47,800
Hear the breeze, I'm sure I'll see your aircraft succeed.

174
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:49,800
What I hope.

175
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:52,600
No, no, no, don't go, I don't want to know.

176
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:53,600
Mixed sweet?

177
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:56,800
Let's say it fails, then you can know something else.

178
00:09:56,800 --> 00:10:02,800
Yeah, but the problem is that I don't want to do anything but tinker with my aircraft.

179
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:05,000
Drive.

180
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Forget the whole thing, niisku-miss, I don't want to know anything.

181
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Oh, good unusual.

182
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Hey, go home now.

183
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
An exciting edge is in your nest.

184
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:33,200
Oh, leave at once, and the house will be spared.

185
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:49,200
Niisku, I brought the last statement.

186
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:53,200
Thank you very much, this is going smoothly.

187
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:55,200
Even yes.

188
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:59,200
You are a great help, thank you.

189
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:04,200
Well, I can't wait for your aircraft to be finished.

190
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:06,200
Where is the niisku lady anyway?

191
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:10,200
He would have wanted to come and help, but I refused.

192
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:11,200
Why?

193
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:17,200
If Ms. Niisku were here, she would see before long whether my aircraft will succeed or not.

194
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:24,200
All the joy would disappear from building.

195
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:27,200
I do understand how you feel.

196
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,200
You know what?

197
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:37,400
Well, if I'm being completely honest, I don't dare to ask the niisku girls about the aircraft.

198
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:42,400
If I knew it was going to fail, I'd go with it.

199
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:00,400
Pee!

200
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:03,400
Ah, you saw me coming.

201
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:08,400
I knew you were looking for me and I also know what you want from me.

202
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:10,400
So what?

203
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:14,400
That I use my clairvoyant abilities to make money.

204
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:17,400
Great, you're a real clairvoyant.

205
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:20,400
I don't want to be your business partner.

206
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:22,400
Don't you want to get rich?

207
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:24,400
Oh, I'm not getting rich.

208
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:25,400
Wait a minute.

209
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:26,400
Not really.

210
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:28,600
You're a bum too.

211
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:32,600
Ha ha, I'm changing our future.

212
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:33,600
Come with me.

213
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:34,600
All right.

214
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:38,600
I won't do that either, even if I reject you, I'll follow you to the end.

215
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:40,600
I give up.

216
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:46,600
This way sir, this way.

217
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:48,600
Can he predict?

218
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:50,600
I guarantee that.

219
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:54,800
I am extremely worried about my health.

220
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:56,800
I am terminally ill.

221
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:58,800
Very healthy.

222
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:02,800
Tell me straight up how much time I have to live.

223
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:06,800
We all die sooner or later.

224
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:10,800
In a way, it's a relief.

225
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:12,800
Am I going to die soon?

226
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:14,800
Wait and see.

227
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:17,800
You have about 90 years left.

228
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Then I get sick.

229
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Are you sure?

230
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:26,000
You will live a little longer if you exercise and follow diets.

231
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Oh my god, that's really fun to hear.

232
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Look at these, special medicines.

233
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:44,000
I thought my days were numbered, so I invested all my money in expensive drugs.

234
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:48,200
Good day, Rauva-Viljonkka. We have been waiting for you.

235
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:50,200
Good day, Nipsu.

236
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:52,200
You're looking to see clearly, aren't you?

237
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:55,200
Well, how do you know that already?

238
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:59,200
I know I can see clearly.

239
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:01,200
I am clear to see.

240
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:03,200
I am clear to see.

241
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:05,200
I am clear to see.

242
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:07,200
I am clear to see.

243
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:09,200
I am clear to see.

244
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:11,200
I am clear to see.

245
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:13,400
I already know that.

246
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:17,400
I know everything because I am the manager of the famous clairvoyant.

247
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:21,400
If you're his manager, no thanks.

248
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:24,400
No, no, no. Wait a minute.

249
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:28,400
I don't even trust your clear vision.

250
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:32,400
However, didn't we know how to correctly predict your arrival?

251
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:38,400
And if the prediction does not come true against all expectations, you get your money back.

252
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:43,400
This way, madam.

253
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:46,400
The convalescent place looks murky.

254
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:49,400
You see, you don't need a nice office.

255
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:52,400
Whoops, there's a customer here.

256
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:56,400
Moist way.

257
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:58,400
Good day, Mrs. Viljonkka.

258
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:00,400
I don't really understand now.

259
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:05,400
Lightning struck Niskunneit and in that moment he gained the ability to see into the future.

260
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:07,400
That you predict?

261
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:09,400
I? Unfortunately.

262
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:11,600
To sit, to sit.

263
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:14,600
Well, that's fine, you'll get your chance.

264
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:19,600
Yes, we would like to collect the payment in advance.

265
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:21,600
Well, you want to.

266
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:23,600
Yes, we don't do anything for contraception with drugs.

267
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:25,600
What are you doing?

268
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:27,600
Hey, I'm fine.

269
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,600
Five of it.

270
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:35,600
Well, Mrs. Viljonkka, please ask clearly now what you want to know.

271
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:38,800
Mistress of Niiskun, predict my future for me.

272
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:40,800
Yes, yes.

273
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:44,800
Now I see.

274
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:46,800
And what do you see?

275
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:49,800
I clearly saw Mrs. Viljonka.

276
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:53,800
Do you see, Do you really see me?

277
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:55,800
I can see very clearly.

278
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:57,800
And what do I do?

279
00:15:57,800 --> 00:15:59,800
Shout out with an umbrella.

280
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:00,800
Huidonko?

281
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:02,800
Yeah, and you look very hot.

282
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:04,800
And then?

283
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
You asked something like an umbrella.

284
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Forget the parasol already.

285
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
What else do you see?

286
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
I don't see anything else.

287
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
That look is all.

288
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Niiskunkunnie, you look more closely.

289
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
Now I see.

290
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
What do you see?

291
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
I see I'm running with Nipsu.

292
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:29,000
But Niiskunneiti, how do you explain Mrs. Viljon?

293
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Oh, terrible.

294
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
What?

295
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:35,200
Us.

296
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:37,200
Don't screw up.

297
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:39,200
Are you making fun of me?

298
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:41,200
Let's go to the ticket office.

299
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:43,200
Don't be surprised by me.

300
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:45,200
Just as I predicted.

301
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:47,200
Yeah, I notice.

302
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:49,200
You are frauds and nosy.

303
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:51,200
Mrs. Viljonka, don't now.

304
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:53,200
Moist way.

305
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:55,200
Please wait.

306
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:57,200
Help.

307
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:59,200
Mrs. Viljonka, don't.

308
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:01,200
Money is added in the air.

309
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:04,400
Niiskunnetti predicted this correctly.

310
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:06,400
You can't run away from me.

311
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:08,400
You see.

312
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:10,400
We won't get rich with this shit.

313
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:12,400
I have a couple of coins in the pivo.

314
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:14,400
They do not have to withdraw money from the lottery.

315
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:16,400
I think?

316
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:19,400
Yeah, you're allowed to peek into the future that much,

317
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:22,400
that you can tell me which number wins.

318
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:25,400
I can't see anything in your eyes yesterday.

319
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:28,400
No problem, I'll lead you.

320
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:31,600
Did closing your eyes help?

321
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:34,600
It helped, but the number is terribly long.

322
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:37,600
Come on, I'm ready.

323
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:39,600
Six three eight.

324
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,600
Six three eight.

325
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:43,600
Two five four.

326
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:45,600
Two five four.

327
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:47,600
I want my money back, take it now.

328
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:49,600
You shut up.

329
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:51,600
Hey, how did that number go again?

330
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:53,600
Six three eight.

331
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:55,600
Six three eight.

332
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:57,600
Six five four.

333
00:17:57,800 --> 00:17:59,800
Two five four.

334
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:01,800
Art is a spy on a sekopol.

335
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:03,800
Two five four.

336
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:05,800
Two five four.

337
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:07,800
Two five four.

338
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
Six three eight.

339
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:13,200
Six three eight.

340
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:15,200
Six five four.

341
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:17,200
Two five four.

342
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:21,400
Fuck us.

343
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:23,400
Six three eight.

344
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:25,400
Two five four.

345
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:27,400
Six three eight.

346
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:31,400
Hi, are you, are you okay?

347
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:35,400
I am, but Niiskunneiti passed out.

348
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:37,400
Niiskunmi, wake up.

349
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:39,400
Hi Niiskuneiti.

350
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:43,400
I'm sorry the tent is collapsing. It was my fault.

351
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:47,400
It is easy to rebuild. He didn't hurt you.

352
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:51,400
Nothing bothers me. Hey, Kola just took my head.

353
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:53,400
Well good. What is that young man?

354
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:55,400
What now?

355
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:57,400
I can't see the number.

356
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:59,400
Try it.

357
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:01,400
I can't see.

358
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:05,400
I don't see anything in the future.

359
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:07,400
Have you lost your clairvoyance?

360
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:09,400
That's how it looks.

361
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:11,400
This partly caused it and...

362
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:13,400
Good, so.

363
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:15,400
Very bad.

364
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:17,400
Lovely, Niiskunneiti.

365
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:19,400
What a relief.

366
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:21,400
On the right, I think it's a shame.

367
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:23,400
How so? Humidity.

368
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:27,400
He would have liked to know if the new aircraft would fly.

369
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:30,400
You said you didn't want to know anything.

370
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:35,400
I know, but really I would have liked to know.

371
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:39,400
That's why I don't need to see into the future.

372
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:40,400
Uh.

373
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:43,400
I can answer that question anyway.

374
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:47,400
I know your aircraft will be a great success.

375
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:49,400
I trust you.

376
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:55,400
Oh, thank you, Niiskunneiti.

377
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:57,400
Come on, Niisku.

378
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:59,400
I'm putting up the tent.

379
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:00,400
Good.

380
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:02,400
Work heals all wounds.

381
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:04,400
This time I want to help.

382
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:06,400
That's fine.

383
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:08,400
Ipsu, up to help.

384
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:09,400
Ah.

385
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:11,400
Arpa.

386
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:22,400
When the partnerships work hard together, the aircraft will surely be completed.

387
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:24,400
Thumbs up.
