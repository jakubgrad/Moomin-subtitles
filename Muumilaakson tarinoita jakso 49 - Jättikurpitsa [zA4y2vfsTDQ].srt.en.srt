1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:19,000
When the frost had finally melted, grandma sowed the pumpkin seeds.

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Why are the seedlings not budding?

3
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I got the seeds a long time ago, if they were out of date.

4
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Yes, they will remain.

5
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
There should be two kinds of flowers, but nothing is visible yet.

6
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Without flowers there is no pollination, and without pollination there is no fruit.

7
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Not a single button is coming.

8
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Then there's no need to wait for pumpkins.

9
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
So yeah, that's what it's starting to feel like.

10
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Oh, what's over there?

11
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Wait a minute! Here is the bud of the mother flower, when there would still be a few stamens.

12
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:30,000
How little button? I guess nothing will come of it.

13
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Before long, three stamens bloomed.

14
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Mom, we haven't had a pumpkin yet this year, have we?

15
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Well no, it looks like the whole crop will fail, there won't be a single pumpkin.

16
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Not a single one?

17
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Fear the worst, Moomin.

18
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Pumpkin pie is good.

19
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Shawl!

20
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Terribly sad.

21
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,000
It looks promising, the bud has opened.

22
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
There will be pumpkins.

23
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Well, one may well come.

24
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Even better than nothing, if you can get one meal for the family.

25
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Only one pumpkin started to grow, but grandma was very proud of it.

26
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Today I harvest pumpkins.

27
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Prepare the pumpkin carefully.

28
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,000
I know a good recipe, everyone can at least taste it.

29
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Great, I've never seen a single direction pumpkin in my life.

30
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Just yesterday it was this small, what has happened?

31
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Very strange.

32
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
The last rain maybe?

33
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Unbelievable.

34
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Can a pumpkin this huge even taste good?

35
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Listen to hemul.

36
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
So?

37
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Just like the pumpkin is still growing.

38
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:17,000
It's the only pumpkin in the entire bench.

39
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Maybe it gets power from other seedlings a bit like electricity.

40
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Non-botanical.

41
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Will the pumpkin grow as big as it wants?

42
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Fixed plot.

43
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,000
I want to keep the pumpkin a secret from the family for the time being.

44
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
All right.

45
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
I want to surprise Papa and Moomin.

46
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
I won't tell anyone.

47
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Thanks.

48
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Mom, I remember you saying a long time ago that there would only be one single pumpkin this year.

49
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Oh shall I say?

50
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Or am I remembering wrong?

51
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:05,000
No, that's what you said and promised bread from pumpkin pie, everyone's favorite.

52
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
May be.

53
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:11,000
It's been weeks. The pumpkin must be big enough.

54
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Big and big.

55
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
I guess it's not rotten.

56
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
I wouldn't say that much, but...

57
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Is it still too small?

58
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:23,000
It needs to grow a little more, then it's...

59
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Yes.

60
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Dad's out for a walk.

61
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
In the garden?

62
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Go to Viljonka.

63
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
And you don't believe it, do you?

64
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,000
I'm going to Viljonkanluo.

65
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
You went there yesterday and the day after.

66
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Why couldn't I go to the same place three times?

67
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
You can, honey.

68
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:55,000
And now I'm going to Viljonkanluo and not anywhere else.

69
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Remarkable. What happened to mom?

70
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Oh no. I'm bad at lying.

71
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Hi Moomin mom! Get running!

72
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Oh, Hemuli!

73
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Is there something wrong with the pumpkin?

74
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Not exactly.

75
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:22,000
But look, the pumpkin keeps growing.

76
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
What do I do?

77
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,000
It's already so big that you can see it from far away.

78
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
It's true.

79
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
No one will find out about the pumpkin.

80
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Share, there may be other puzzles.

81
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
What puzzles?

82
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Someone can steal it.

83
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Oh, who the hell would steal my pumpkin?

84
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,000
We have to be on our guard.

85
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Let's disguise a pumpkin.

86
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Joo.

87
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Well, you can't see it now, but you know him.

88
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Who would have guessed.

89
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
But some poke their noses everywhere.

90
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
You.

91
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Some people feel like taking a peek at what's behind the fence.

92
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:10,000
I'm not meant to keep secrets.

93
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Oh.

94
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
What was it?

95
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Mother?

96
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Oh, I was a bit careless.

97
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
In.

98
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Yes.

99
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
What's wrong, boy?

100
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
I'm worried.

101
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Whence?

102
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
From mother.

103
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
He is behaving strangely.

104
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Oh, you've noticed too.

105
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
What's wrong with mom?

106
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:59,000
I just don't know, but he sometimes tells obvious emergency lies.

107
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Oh.

108
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
And you know, today he broke one of grandma's plates.

109
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
What does he have?

110
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Couldn't you ask mom directly?

111
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Me?

112
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
So who else?

113
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Mmm, you're right.

114
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
I'm asking.

115
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Don't show that you are worried about him.

116
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Would he go to mother?

117
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Joo.

118
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Is Moomin at home?

119
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Yes?

120
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Moomin, what's on your mind?

121
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Far away?

122
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
You're weird.

123
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
What do you want?

124
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
I'm just asking if Moomin is home.

125
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Miss Niisku is sick right now.

126
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
I am very worried.

127
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,000
It's nothing serious, just a cold.

128
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Uh, I didn't mean niisku-mistress.

129
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Who are you worried about?

130
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Well, about mom.

131
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
What's wrong with Moomin?

132
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
I don't know, something is weighing on his mind.

133
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Mmm, mommy was distracted.

134
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Did you notice too?

135
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Don't worry, the old one will be gone.

136
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Mom is not old.

137
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Moomin looked at the sky.

138
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
What then?

139
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Well, my mother is just worried about the weather.

140
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,000
No, it's about something bigger.

141
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Papa, do you think it will rain tomorrow?

142
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,000
I don't know, probably not.

143
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Oh-oh, I hope not, or else...

144
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Or else what?

145
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
I'm going to make dinner.

146
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Mamma!

147
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
We are married.

148
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Well, what the hell is wrong with you?

149
00:08:52,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Isn't it only natural that if the wife is in trouble due to marital partnerships, the man wants to help her.

150
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
And I want to help.

151
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
What?

152
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Well, you.

153
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Why?

154
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Oh why, because you're in trouble.

155
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,000
And I'm not, I'm not in any trouble.

156
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Yes, but...

157
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Moomin thinks you're in trouble.

158
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:20,000
He's got something wrong, just like you.

159
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Everything is excellent.

160
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Say what you say, you're in trouble, I feel it.

161
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Oh, I don't have to show that I'm worried now.

162
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Tomorrow you can finally get up.

163
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Oh, I could have enjoyed it already today, but my brother didn't give permission.

164
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Does the breeze cook for you?

165
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
We are in the whole.

166
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
One thing at a time, Moomin.

167
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
You looked kind of miserable.

168
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,000
He is worried about Moomin.

169
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Momma Moomin has gotten into a lot of trouble.

170
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Really?

171
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
In!

172
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,000
It's a bit early, but the food is ready.

173
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Oh, thank you.

174
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
I cooked you food.

175
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Thanks.

176
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Mummy Moomin!

177
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
What are you pushing so hard for?

178
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
I almost caught you.

179
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
I didn't notice at all.

180
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Well, why are you in such an impossible hurry?

181
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
I'm worried.

182
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
I'm worried.

183
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
I'm worried.

184
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
I'm worried.

185
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
I'm worried.

186
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
I'm worried.

187
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
I'm worried.

188
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
It's such an impossible rush.

189
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
I haven't been to see it.

190
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Watching what?

191
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,000
I have to tell you before you crack.

192
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Cracks?

193
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,000
What's going on there?

194
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Stink, don't touch it, he didn't spoil it.

195
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,000
No, I was just looking at a pretty big pumpkin.

196
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Pumpkin?

197
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,000
My secret is behind the fence.

198
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,000
I wanted to surprise the family.

199
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,000
That's why I've been hiding my pumpkin.

200
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,000
But now Haisuli has found it.

201
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Isn't the pumpkin already so big that it surprises anyone.

202
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
ha ISu Li, black!

203
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,000
He knows how to be clever.

204
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Where are you going?

205
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Giant pumpkin.

206
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Is it still growing?

207
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
I can't say.

208
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Now I understand why mom was so weird.

209
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,000
A big thing to hide.

210
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Can it be eaten?

211
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Of course. It could be sold at a high price.

212
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
You only think about money.

213
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,000
There is enough pumpkin to eat for a year.

214
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Let it grow some more.

215
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Let's make sure no one steals it.

216
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:50,000
The skunk has already seen the pumpkin. You can't keep your mouth shut.

217
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Moominpapa guessed right.

218
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:58,000
People came from all over Moomin Valley to see the pumpkin.

219
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Sorry. Do you know where that giant pumpkin grows?

220
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
This way.

221
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
He's in the car.

222
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
He's in the car.

223
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
It can be overwhelming.

224
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
He's in the car.

225
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
It can be harsh.

226
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
It can't be harsh.

227
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
It can't be harsh.

228
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
It can't be harsh.

229
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Stand tight in line and wait your turn.

230
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Moomin's garden must not be messed with.

231
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
What darkness?

232
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,000
I told Moominma that she must demand the entrance fee.

233
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Nipsua, don't be a toupee.

234
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Even Moominpappa didn't think it was a good idea, but it's worth paying to see a pumpkin.

235
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Niisku, step forward, you will be amazed.

236
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Thanks.

237
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Oh Brother, you're not much bigger than I knew the dreamer.

238
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Oh, and Niisku, the pumpkin is still growing.

239
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Amazing. Scientific observations must be made about it.

240
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:18,000
People have come from far away to see the pumpkin.

241
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Mamma is becoming famous.

242
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Dad, why don't you go to bed already?

243
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
I think I'll push.

244
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:32,000
I am old enough that being on duty is a bit of a burden.

245
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Let's hope the pumpkin doesn't grow anymore.

246
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Let's hope. Good night.

247
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Good night.

248
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
I'll pay a hundred gold coins.

249
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Because of that pumpkin.

250
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
No, no, it's...

251
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Someone has already offered a higher amount than that.

252
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,000
It's good. 200 gold coins.

253
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Pumpkin is my wife.

254
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:12,000
He has grown it and has no intention of selling it.

255
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Bring your wife here quickly. Where is he?

256
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Doing the dishes. We can't sell the pumpkin because we're going to eat it.

257
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Pumpkin is good.

258
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:25,000
What gluttons! Now who would eat a show piece?

259
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
An exhibition piece?

260
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
Pumpkin.

261
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
The pumpkin is stored.

262
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:58,000
That's right, it's my shift a lot.

263
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Father, father.

264
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
What happened now?

265
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
Nothing. My shift is starting.

266
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:13,000
Oh yeah. Glad you came. Otapa on the stick.

267
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Dad was fast asleep.

268
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
The pumpkin has disappeared.

269
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
What?

270
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Look!

271
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Stop! Six!

272
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
That too! Aisuli!

273
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
AI Suri!

274
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
AI Suri!

275
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
You can't have Aisuli.

276
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
Not my pumpkin now.

277
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
Pumpkin.

278
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:54,000
The pumpkin was such a picture that grandma's knife didn't work on it.

279
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:58,000
You can take a pumpkin and carve it for help.

280
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
Pumpkin.

281
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:46,000
A big pumpkin party was held in the Moomin house.

282
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:50,000
Pumpkin pie jelly, hight and cake were served

283
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,000
have pumpkin lemonade to drink.

284
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
You make cookies.

285
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:58,000
I've never had such good pumpkin.

286
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
Overdrive!

287
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
Very good seller.

288
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:20,000
Little My wanted a pumpkin shell for his hut.

289
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:25,000
There was still enough pumpkin malt left on the walls,

290
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:29,000
that Pikku Mylle was left to be hawked for dinner.
