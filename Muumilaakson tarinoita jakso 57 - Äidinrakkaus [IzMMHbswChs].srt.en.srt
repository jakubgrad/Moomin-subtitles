1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:21,000
There is nothing bad to say about the books, but sometimes they seem unnecessarily strong.

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Just like before.

3
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Just like that.

4
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Good morning, as usual.

5
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
As usual, good morning.

6
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Did you say something?

7
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
I wished you good morning.

8
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Is it morning already?

9
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Just don't say you've been up all night reading that book.

10
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,000
A mother's love is so sweet.

11
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Did your mother's love keep you awake?

12
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Oh to have children and drown them in love.

13
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,000
As far as I know, you have to get married first.

14
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Oh, I'd dress my titties in frills and they'd worship me like the boys do, even if they don't have frills now.

15
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
How many children do you dream of having?

16
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,000
I'm all about mother's love.

17
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Two dozen would be a good number.

18
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,000
In that case, you can leave me off the bills.

19
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
What are you up to so early?

20
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Myy.

21
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Please know that I must not be woken up yet.

22
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Like there's something strange going on.

23
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
It is. Why don't you sleep?

24
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:27,000
I look just like my mother. Do you agree?

25
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Some are simply born to be mothers.

26
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Maybe so.

27
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Moomin! Moomin!

28
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
What, mom?

29
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
I'm a mother.

30
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
I'm a mother.

31
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
I'm a mother.

32
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
I'm a mother.

33
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
What, mom? What matter?

34
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Oh, there you are.

35
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Two clueless children are lying on the porch.

36
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Don't now.

37
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Pretty small.

38
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Oh wonder.

39
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Say something else. Would you help carry them in?

40
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Two small children.

41
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
What the hell is wrong with them?

42
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
If only you knew.

43
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
What now, swamp lady?

44
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Fate has taken over.

45
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Oh well.

46
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Oh, the horror.

47
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Hey, listen.

48
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
What's wrong with you?

49
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
He's really warm.

50
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
And he doesn't seem to have hurt himself.

51
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Oh, you little roaches.

52
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:55,000
They must have wandered all night when they got here.

53
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:00,000
What kind of parents do they have when they have let their little children go astray?

54
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Very hungry.

55
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
There is food for this.

56
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
They would wake up.

57
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
You heard what they said.

58
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Chop all the food.

59
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Wait two years.

60
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Warm water, thermometer, aspirin, bandages just in case.

61
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Eat as much as you can handle tight socks.

62
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Who exactly are you?

63
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Nips.

64
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Where are you from? Where are mom and dad?

65
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,000
The horror, what happened?

66
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Father and stepmother left us in the forest while we were asleep.

67
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
To the wolf's mouth!

68
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
What the hell.

69
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Our own mother is dead. We have a mean stepmother and she hates us for being so pretty.

70
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,000
He persuades father to leave us to be eaten by bets.

71
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,000
That reminds me of something.

72
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Little children, don't be sad. I will be your new mother.

73
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Don't go to the bowl?

74
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Are you sure?

75
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
My food said yes.

76
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Keep those good kisses alive.

77
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Note that they have not been loved.

78
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,000
They are not used to being shown affection, but they get love from me.

79
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Oh, they get love from me.

80
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:46,000
We are in no rush. There is enough time in the world by any measure.

81
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Oh I'll wrap you in love and it's soft like cotton candy.

82
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Miss, are you all right?

83
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Are you sure she wants kids?

84
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:02,000
I want to. I mature at night and I know my part.

85
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Sounds.

86
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,000
What's wrong, you're a good mother.

87
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
There are carts here.

88
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
I know the carts too.

89
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Grandma, the kids need strollers more than you do.

90
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Be teary-eyed and hop on board.

91
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Mom pushes you.

92
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
I'm done!

93
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Disrepair.

94
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Let's push mom sometimes.

95
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Mom, come along for the ride.

96
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Oh my little darlings, you are so perceptive.

97
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Mom, come along for the ride.

98
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Shut up. It bothers me.

99
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Mother.

100
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
I don't call.

101
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Mothers don't call.

102
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Mother.

103
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
A new day.

104
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:39,000
I have to get up before the cultists.

105
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Wait, you don't remember, you don't hug mom yet.

106
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Don't you muse?

107
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:12,000
How is it going, is taking care of the little monsters getting annoying?

108
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Don't you call my golden knobs monsters.

109
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:23,000
It's no fun when he never gets mad at us.

110
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,000
I want to stay away.

111
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Mother.

112
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Help.

113
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
That was it.

114
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
I'll catch you guys.

115
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Mom helps.

116
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Stand up. Moomi papa, it's not right to think about my children.

117
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,000
You should be a little tougher on them.

118
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Neither do I.

119
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:59,000
You'd even get mad at them. Those tricks just weren't funny at all.

120
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:05,000
It's an irrelevant question, but ask yourself why they pulled that stunt.

121
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
What do you mean?

122
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Children's playgrounds have apparently never had their own swing.

123
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Do you not realize that they have been subdued and depressed?

124
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Ova's lack of a hammock lulled them into powerlessness.

125
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:23,000
You mean I should make them a hammock?

126
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Oh Moomin papa, I knew you would understand.

127
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:33,000
You mean I should make them a hammock?

128
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:37,000
You mean I should make them a hammock?

129
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:41,000
You mean I should make them a hammock?

130
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:46,000
You mean I should make them a hammock?

131
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:51,000
You mean I should make them a hammock?

132
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:56,000
You mean I should make them a hammock?

133
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Well, there's a hammock for you.

134
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:13,000
We'll see how long the swing can withstand that wear and tear.

135
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Ugh, this is so boring.

136
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Let's figure something else out.

137
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,000
What are mom's little darlings up to?

138
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,000
What are mom's little darlings up to?

139
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
I won't tell.

140
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Oh, you don't tell mom.

141
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
It's a secret.

142
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Well, we all have our little secrets.

143
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:08,000
At least mom is happy when you're not doing bad things.

144
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Ah, that's what the mother of the neck is.

145
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
You look pleased.

146
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Are the monsters if you don't do it?

147
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:23,000
After all, I'm a mother, I miss nothing more than seeing my little ones immersed in their games.

148
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
The tricks show intelligence.

149
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
What are they currently doing?

150
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Mud bottom.

151
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:32,000
What are they currently doing?

152
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,000
What are they currently doing?

153
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
What are they currently doing?

154
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Mud balls.

155
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,000
It's their soma secret.

156
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Good target.

157
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Shall we start?

158
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Soma secret.

159
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Soak the hammock with mud balls.

160
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Carry on or play, darlings.

161
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Mom wash as a hangover.

162
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
No.

163
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Tomorrow boy.

164
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Did it hurt you?

165
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Enkai.

166
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Oh moms, I'm dying for crumbs.

167
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Stop it, kids.

168
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
This will be taught.

169
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Thank you sell.

170
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
This is not what the vints can survive.

171
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Now the mud war begins.

172
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Wait a minute.

173
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
There is something strange here.

174
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
They are right there.

175
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Give me more.

176
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Joo.

177
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Stop now.

178
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Wake up.

179
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Stop it.

180
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
Mom, you've got the cones.

181
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Stop it.

182
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
You can hurt yourself.

183
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Myy.

184
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
I'll come to the rescue.

185
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Good thing.

186
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Rapataan is not a rondit.

187
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
You're a moron too.

188
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Hoomipeika and sell.

189
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Stop it.

190
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Stop it.

191
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Can't hear the words?

192
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Tomorrow you will even stop.

193
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:11,000
As if you chose a bad place.

194
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Move out of the line of fire.

195
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Ahead of faith.

196
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
I'm a mother.

197
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,000
A mother's love is overflowing.

198
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:27,000
But I'm also a very tired mother.

199
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Now you're teasing me.

200
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
What I'm doing now.

201
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
I do mother for love.

202
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
I don't understand where the children are.

203
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Do to death.

204
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Finally the mud war ended.

205
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:12,000
It was actually quite refreshing.

206
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
It must have been fun here.

207
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
Terribly fun.

208
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Hello, Hoomipeikko. What are we playing now?

209
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,000
It's a joke that you are prisoners.

210
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:32,000
And we keep you in the torture chamber.

211
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Next you go to trim the porch.

212
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
It's covered in mud.

213
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:43,000
So you don't know where the children ended up after they got lost in the woods.

214
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,000
I don't fear the worst. This is horrible.

215
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Don't be sad. I interview the residents of the surrounding area.

216
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Well, nips and nips. Isn't it time for a real discussion?

217
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Who is there?

218
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:03,000
The Moomins. You don't usually wash the outside of the house.

219
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:06,000
Drugs seem to have a lot of children.

220
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:09,000
No. There are two guests.

221
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Mother!

222
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Mother!

223
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Mother!

224
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
Mother!

225
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
Mother!

226
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Oh, my child has been kidnapped.

227
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,000
Harjelko, hardly at all.

228
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Are you their mother?

229
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:30,000
The children just came to drag like slaves.

230
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Good lady. This is a police matter.

231
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:38,000
Glad you found mom.

232
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,000
I'm not looking for motherhood, but her children.

233
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
Joo.

234
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:46,000
This lady's children have been missing all week.

235
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:50,000
Can you explain why they are cleaning at your place?

236
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
No ha...

237
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,000
This could be a serious thing in values, Moomin papa.

238
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Kidnapping is a felony.

239
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
No, not the policeman.

240
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,000
Hey, we're not Moomin, kidnappers.

241
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
Ai.

242
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:10,000
But then what are you here for?

243
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,000
Nips and nips. I want to hear the answer right away.

244
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:18,000
Well, when the kids came up with one new game for us.

245
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,000
And what kind of game is that?

246
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:27,000
We played that we had been left in the forest to be eaten by wolves and then we came to the Moomins.

247
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
We had a lot of fun.

248
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
You guys are killing me.

249
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,000
Try to calm down, dear lady.

250
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
Mother!

251
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:44,000
Don't get upset over a small thing again. It's so terribly embarrassing.

252
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:49,000
I'll show you what's embarrassing about it.

253
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
Help!

254
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:54,000
Wait till I catch you guys. Wait!

255
00:18:55,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Hey there, the game is over for today, but we'll be back.

256
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Don't be stingy.

257
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:07,000
They have apparently run away before.

258
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:10,000
And hung out at home.

259
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:14,000
Dear children, don't let yourself be caught up in them.

260
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:17,000
Just run and come visit sometime.

261
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:22,000
The home feels quiet now that the little...

262
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
The golds are gone.

263
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:28,000
Yes, I just hope that Niiskunnemi didn't regret it.

264
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
Oi and, and.

265
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:35,000
A mother's love is better enjoyed only in moderate doses.

266
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,000
You will still be a wise mother.

267
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
Thanks mom.

268
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:44,000
Where is the sale? I haven't seen him all day.

269
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
He is reading upstairs.

270
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
That's unusual.

271
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:52,000
I guess he's not reading the same book about mother's happiness.

272
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,000
I don't think so, but he is completely under the spell of the book.

273
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:58,000
He doesn't even answer when you talk to him.

274
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:02,000
He finds out the facts of life.

275
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
Don't disturb him.

276
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
Mother

277
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:17,000
When I grow up, I'll be a sea rosso.

278
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:24,000
I am interested in selling the joys of motherhood.

279
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:28,000
And he seems to have already figured out the facts of life.
