1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,000
There may be life in outer space, although we don't know what kind.

2
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Space creatures can even resemble jellyfish in appearance.

3
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:30,000
But at least this isn't an alien, because this is Nipsu, a friend of the Moomins.

4
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Cool, cool, cool, cool!

5
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Help, help, help, help, help!

6
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Hey, hey, hey!

7
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
So that rumor is true.

8
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
What rumor? I haven't even heard.

9
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,000
That the creatures of outer space have invaded Moominvalley.

10
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
You mean I just saw a real flying saucer?

11
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
I mean.

12
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
They were going to kidnap me.

13
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Hardly.

14
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
You mean I just saw a real flying saucer?

15
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
I mean.

16
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
They were going to kidnap me.

17
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
They hardly thought you were that important.

18
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Although you never know.

19
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:51,000
In this book, the Martians are said to be very civilized and peace-loving.

20
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
They wouldn't bother to attack us.

21
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
However, the book is not very scientific.

22
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Some creature was going to attack me in Takuu.

23
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Maybe it wasn't from Mars or some other planet.

24
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
The monster was hungry.

25
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:13,000
The police claim that aliens have invaded Moomin Valley from outer space.

26
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
A few flying saucers, perhaps.

27
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
What kind of people are they?

28
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Moomin, come help me garden. Maybe we will see some space object.

29
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Mom, I'm coming.

30
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Oops, what's that?

31
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
At least not a vegetable, that's for sure.

32
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
It must be a flying saucer.

33
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Is it full of strangers?

34
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Which are like Tuusa's snuff.

35
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Let's go see.

36
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
There appears to be a door opening.

37
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,000
It's a remarkable vector. What is it?

38
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Radio maybe.

39
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Alien radio.

40
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Is there anyone there?

41
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Is there anyone there?

42
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
There isn't.

43
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Is there anyone there?

44
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Is there anyone there?

45
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Is there anyone there?

46
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Hi, is anyone there?

47
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Not a living soul.

48
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
No, but what's that sound?

49
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
This saucer will probably never fly again.

50
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Maybe it can be fixed.

51
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Who would fix it?

52
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Well, at least not papa.

53
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Do you hear flying saucers make that strange noise?

54
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
I don't think so.

55
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:53,000
The space aliens are apparently afraid that we will copy their flying saucer.

56
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:57,000
For that they have programmed it to explode.

57
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
In the middle of the asparagus bed.

58
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Let's hurry out from under it before it crashes.

59
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:09,000
And it will probably be a blast. That's why there is no one inside the plate.

60
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Let's take Vekot with us.

61
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Mom, it will happen soon.

62
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
I guess so.

63
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Lautainen disappeared.

64
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Guard me.

65
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,000
The book knew that space aliens are advanced.

66
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:46,000
There weren't many pieces of evidence left of the flying saucer crash.

67
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
This tip just sucks.

68
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Dad, what is it?

69
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:59,000
I don't know. At least there are a lot of pieces.

70
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Let's try a little.

71
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Let's start with red.

72
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Tel!

73
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Dad, where are you?

74
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Stupid question. And you don't have eyes in your head.

75
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Dad, to be honest, I can't see you either.

76
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
That what?

77
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Yes.

78
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,000
When you press the red button it becomes invisible.

79
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Time Vekotin.

80
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
I think it's more fun to see you.

81
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Of course.

82
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Come on, let's press the yellow button.

83
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Can you see me now?

84
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
I can't see you.

85
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Remarkable.

86
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Shall I push the button for you?

87
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Press.

88
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
I'm already pressing.

89
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
I see you.

90
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
I guess Vekotin is dangerous.

91
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,000
I don't want to become invisible.

92
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,000
All sorts of things are invented.

93
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Mamma, let's put it somewhere safe.

94
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Let's do that.

95
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Moomi, Peikka!

96
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
What is it? What has happened?

97
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
We found Auda's creature.

98
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
The creature?

99
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
It must be an alien.

100
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Share, does it look like a jellyfish?

101
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Not a bit.

102
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
The little one is keeping an eye on it.

103
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Oh, come quickly, come quickly.

104
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Way to go, Moomi papa.

105
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Not anywhere, anyway.

106
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Moomin, you could help me with the research.

107
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Oh right?

108
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:10,000
It is said that the hovercraft is a vegetable that has landed in the garden.

109
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
But it's not just a big man here.

110
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000
What have you done to the flying saucer?

111
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
We do nothing.

112
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,000
So where is the hoverboard?

113
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,000
It took and disappeared immediately.

114
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Disappeared?

115
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
So he did.

116
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,000
That the hoverboard flew his way.

117
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,000
So it was lost, in one fell swoop.

118
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Moomi Peikko also saw.

119
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Very remarkable.

120
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
The song?

121
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Were there aliens on the plate?

122
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Not a single one.

123
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Is that the whole point?

124
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Why would I lie?

125
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
I can't think of a reason.

126
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Sorry now, but it's unnerving like aliens have invaded Moomin Valley.

127
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
So, can we go already?

128
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Just go.

129
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Where are you going anyway?

130
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,000
For Anna, to collect these shoes.

131
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Have a nice rest of the day.

132
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:10,000
To collect these shoes while I get aliens from the forest.

133
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Hey, this way!

134
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Is it an alien?

135
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
It looks completely different from the book.

136
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Have you tried talking to it?

137
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
I am but it doesn't respond.

138
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Come on, have you come from space?

139
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,000
He seems like a child to me.

140
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Reminds me of a lamp.

141
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
He must be hungry.

142
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Let's take him to us.

143
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,000
But he hates that the police can't see.

144
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Let's talk.

145
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Unfortunately, we don't understand you, but you certainly drink milk.

146
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Even if you don't speak our language.

147
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Oh poor thing, he misses his home planet.

148
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,000
He couldn't have come alone from that far.

149
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Where are his father and mother?

150
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:41,000
I can't know, but he's clearly homesick.

151
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Would the police arrest this innocent child?

152
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Who knows, he is officially another man.

153
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,000
I have never seen a more harmless lamp in my life.

154
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Probably not.

155
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
He is.

156
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Oh, the police are coming.

157
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:03,000
We have to hide the alien.

158
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Haisuli is in police custody.

159
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:11,000
The skunk knows boredom. Hide the creature in the kitchen.

160
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,000
We have to do something.

161
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
The thing doesn't fade away.

162
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
I know what to do.

163
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
So what mom?

164
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Let's use that trigger.

165
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Puller?

166
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,000
I stay invisible for a while.

167
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
It was this natto.

168
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
They are here.

169
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Hello Moominpappa. They say there's an alien here.

170
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
What the hell.

171
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Oh my goodness, how you shine.

172
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,000
So I shine. Yes, it's a remarkable case.

173
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
You're like a worm.

174
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Knight in shining armor you mean?

175
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
That's exactly what you look like.

176
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,000
You don't even need a lamp anymore.

177
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Yes, criminals can be afraid of me now.

178
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,000
I'm going to quickly show myself.

179
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
You will be admired.

180
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Duty calls. Goodbye.

181
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
What are you doing now?

182
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,000
I don't know now that the clues still work.

183
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
You can talk.

184
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Of course I can talk. I would have liked to talk to you right away.

185
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,000
If you hadn't hidden my translation machine.

186
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,000
That's how easy it is to translate.

187
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Where are you going?

188
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,000
To look at that shining man. The police will arrest you.

189
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
He came here looking for you.

190
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,000
But forgot about it when you started to glow.

191
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Don't go.

192
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Come back.

193
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:21,000
I like the electric glow. It reminds me of my home region.

194
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Hello police.

195
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
So what now?

196
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
I'll accommodate me.

197
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
What?

198
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:32,000
That's what you gloss over and deny so beautifully.

199
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Do you think so?

200
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
In our house, everything sparkles.

201
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,000
It must look funny.

202
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
I want to comply.

203
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
It would be fun to pack with you.

204
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Moomin are these aliens and I have to find them.

205
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Oh yeah.

206
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:56,000
I had to ask if aliens had been seen in the Moomin house.

207
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
The police will come back.

208
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
What about aliens?

209
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Running after the police.

210
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Is the hand in the bag?

211
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Not as far as I saw.

212
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
In the name of the law, open the door immediately.

213
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
By all means, come in.

214
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:26,000
We have nothing to hide.

215
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Based on the information I received from a reliable source, you've gone nuts here.

216
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
A stranger?

217
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Either again.

218
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:40,000
In other words, you've been hiding aliens.

219
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
It's a hill.

220
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,000
We haven't hidden anything.

221
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Were you hiding something?

222
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Why would I hide?

223
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,000
The skunk played tricks on me again.

224
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Fortunately, he won't find you now.

225
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Here is the reliable of that nice policeman.

226
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
He will throw you in the pipe.

227
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
You don't want to go there.

228
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Like that police.

229
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Don't go!

230
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:14,000
I turn the yellow button, and the police are glaring.

231
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
All right, honey.

232
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
And suddenly, too.

233
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
This is the yellow button.

234
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Come on.

235
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
He doesn't want to run the police.

236
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
He has not thrown the police.

237
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:41,000
He doesn't want to run after the police when he doesn't shine anymore.

238
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
In.

239
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Let's go home then.

240
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Ha ha Moomin, come look, we saved the alien.

241
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:56,000
The police don't shine anymore, come and have a look, momma.

242
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Mamma!

243
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Mom, where are you?

244
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
I'm here.

245
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Hey, where, honey?

246
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
I can't see you.

247
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Here I am.

248
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Oh no, what happened now?

249
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,000
I don't know, this is the reason for the trick.

250
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Not only does it make invisible, it also shrinks.

251
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Oh jeez, what do I do now?

252
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:34,000
I'm getting me a handbag for a handkerchief.

253
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:40,000
You're a little bitty, but still very funny looking.

254
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Would you like to be like that for a while?

255
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Don't talk nonsense, please, press the button, quickly, before someone sees me.

256
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Well, wait a minute.

257
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
What now?

258
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Home has disappeared.

259
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Is there?

260
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:03,000
Hey, listen, give it back.

261
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
A thief too.

262
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Kill.

263
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Don't worry about the trigger back.

264
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Wake up, come back.

265
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
In the database.

266
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,000
Omipeikko, grab Stink.

267
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
All right, dad.

268
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:33,000
Hi, Nipsu, I'll catch the thief.

269
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Nipsu, you don't know I'm giving you a gold coin.

270
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
Right?

271
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Palme, not five.

272
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Five? Hey, I'll put the vector here.

273
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Don't try anything.

274
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
Did you get away with it?

275
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Where is the vector?

276
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
The skunk threw it to the bottom of the river.

277
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:09,000
Oh, oh, oh, mother fucks me.

278
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
What's wrong with mom?

279
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:14,000
He can't get back to his former self without a trigger.

280
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Back to normality.

281
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Now I have the opportunity to do really nice sewing jobs.

282
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Mom, don't worry, we'll take care of you.

283
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Thanks, I'll be fine.

284
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Although I guess I have to get new pots and pans for myself.

285
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:23,100
I'm leaving now

286
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:25,820
Te20.

287
00:18:40,060 --> 00:18:42,060
Te20.

288
00:18:42,060 --> 00:18:50,700
...

289
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:53,660
Aitika!

290
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:56,940

What can you bring?

297
00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:21,860
Did they come to pick you up?

298
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:24,860
Yeah, I took a flying saucer without permission.

299
00:19:24,860 --> 00:19:28,860
Could you ask your parents to return the other mimamma to its former size?

300
00:19:28,860 --> 00:19:30,860
Of course!

301
00:19:31,860 --> 00:19:32,860
I'll show you.

302
00:19:32,860 --> 00:19:34,860
I have to look at you.

303
00:19:34,860 --> 00:19:36,860
Where is the collection mamimu?

304
00:19:42,860 --> 00:19:43,860
Wake up!

305
00:19:43,860 --> 00:19:45,860
Well, it's starting to look familiar.

306
00:19:49,860 --> 00:19:51,860
Oh, six!

307
00:19:51,860 --> 00:19:53,860
Now it was too much.

308
00:19:53,860 --> 00:19:56,860
Sorry, could you try again?

309
00:19:57,860 --> 00:19:58,860
Help!

310
00:19:58,860 --> 00:20:01,860
I can't bear such a heavy spirit.

311
00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:11,860
So the aliens didn't take over Moominvalley, but the people of the valley found out what the aliens look like.

312
00:20:11,860 --> 00:20:15,860
Although they may look different.
