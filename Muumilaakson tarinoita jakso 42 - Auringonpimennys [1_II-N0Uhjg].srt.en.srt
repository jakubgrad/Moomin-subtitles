1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,000
A beautiful day has dawned in Moominlaakso.

2
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Oh, good, clear sky!

3
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Good morning, mom.

4
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Good morning, my Troll.

5
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
The sun is finally shining.

6
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:42,000
It's funny, papa is looking for pieces of glass to look at the sun through.

7
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I'm going out.

8
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Good morning, dad.

9
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Good morning.

10
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
It's an old windowpane.

11
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Yeah, you shouldn't throw anything away.

12
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
What did you say?

13
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Well, when I have to break the glass into six smaller parts.

14
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Knock it against something sharp.

15
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:14,000
No, no, it only produces nasty shards that you can get in your leg.

16
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I guess so.

17
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Amjainen is busy.

18
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:24,000
The glass should be divided into six parts. How can you avoid chips flying?

19
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Grandma used to always put wet paper on either side of the glass before hitting it with a hammer.

20
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Genius.

21
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Awkward shards of glass stick to wet paper. Yes, grandma knew.

22
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,000
I guess you don't need the glasses to be small right away.

23
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
No, let's do it after breakfast.

24
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Joo.

25
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Hmm, it's getting cloudy.

26
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
The solar eclipse cannot be seen if the sky is cloudy.

27
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Well, not like that.

28
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Clouds, go away, go away!

29
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,000
I'm so nervous that I can't eat more. I'll get some candles.

30
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Take it easy. The solar eclipse is visible only in the afternoon and it comes very precisely.

31
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Yeah, but I can't be in my fields.

32
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:29,000
It doesn't take more than five minutes to fix the pieces of glass.

33
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,000
But... oh! Clouds!

34
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Alas, at the time of the previous solar eclipse, I was still a child.

35
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
So do I.

36
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Better, perhaps, to have clouds now, rather than later.

37
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Sweeten this air.

38
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
But you're going to leave anyway.

39
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Of course. Witchcraft intensifies during a solar eclipse.

40
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Yes, but doesn't it hurt somehow if the sun is hidden behind the clouds?

41
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
It will become clear.

42
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:15,000
I just mean that during a solar eclipse the sun is hidden.

43
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
So does it matter?

44
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
How can you ask such stupid questions if you want to become a witch?

45
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Do you know what solar eclipse causes it?

46
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Great!

47
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Grandma, what remarkable thing are you going to do there at the end of the year?

48
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Helper of the black sun of the demon. It strengthens my magic power.

49
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:39,000
There's no need for that. You're a good enough witch anyway.

50
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Of course, but there's always room for more.

51
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
But first I nourish myself with toadstool soup.

52
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Pour water.

53
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
That's enough.

54
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Light.

55
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Oh.

56
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Great dad.

57
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Let's drag the little pieces onto this paper.

58
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Shall we light a candle?

59
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Where is it?

60
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
What do you mean?

61
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Solar eclipse.

62
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Sell, it's not until the afternoon.

63
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Oh, just then.

64
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
It's broken glass for us.

65
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Oh me too?

66
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Of course.

67
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Thanks.

68
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
What do you get out of this?

69
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:51,000
If you look at the sun without glasses, your eyes will be damaged.

70
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
A solar eclipse is dangerous.

71
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
I can't see the sun.

72
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Don't whine.

73
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,000
I can't see anything at all.

74
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Of course not, the sun is covered by clouds.

75
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
I guess so.

76
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Which one would be clear in the afternoon.

77
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Otherwise we will not see that the sun is not visible.

78
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Crazy.

79
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
More clouds.

80
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
You would stay home.

81
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Don't talk to the restless.

82
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:27,000
That's how a strong gust of wind drives the clouds apart many times.

83
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Hey.

84
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Lovely.

85
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Now I can go see Moomin.

86
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Primitive people believed that the sun went dark because someone spoiled the animal.

87
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:55,000
But the sun grew back every time.

88
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Right, but they were primitive.

89
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:03,000
They beat the drums so that the animal had to throw up the sun back.

90
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Make fun of it.

91
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Are the clouds echoing?

92
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
It doesn't look like it.

93
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
I would have wanted you to see the eclipse.

94
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Let's hope that the sky will be cloudless at the time of the next solar eclipse.

95
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Then you're an old man.

96
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
I'm so disappointed.

97
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
There's still time for the blackout!

98
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Which wind would disperse the clouds?

99
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
The wind is blowing!

100
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Drive the clouds away from the sun!

101
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Hey!

102
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Thank you, Alice.

103
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Hello Snuff-muikkunen!

104
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Are you dying to see Moomin?

105
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
I came!

106
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Oh brothers, what a wind!

107
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
The air is clearing!

108
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Who knows if we will see a solar eclipse after all?

109
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Oh!

110
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Someone is gnawing on the sun.

111
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
I wouldn't have believed it.

112
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
What the hell are you on about?

113
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Solar eclipse through stained glass.

114
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
An eclipse?

115
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Yes, the moon eclipses the sun.

116
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
And you can see it through the glass, right?

117
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Joo.

118
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Give me too.

119
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
There is no extra.

120
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
What do you have in your hand?

121
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
It's for Snuff.

122
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Just like that.

123
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Muikkune just went fishing on a boat.

124
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Hardly, just in this mood.

125
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:38,000
A real fisherman doesn't give a damn about the weather.

126
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
The fish don't eat in this weather.

127
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Au, au, au!

128
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Let me take a look.

129
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
But give it back when Snuff-muikkunen comes.

130
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
No up, up!

131
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Oh, oh, how wonderful!

132
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Will the sack get dark?

133
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Evening probably like Hämärä.

134
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Hämärä is a good burglar.

135
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Ha ha ha!

136
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Alisa is in it.

137
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Snuff-mikkunen!

138
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
ha Isu Li...

139
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
He i is still beautiful!

140
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
I can borrow it and get it back after the solar eclipse.

141
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Red kettle.

142
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Hello everyone!

143
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Nice to see!

144
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Did grandma give you permission to come?

145
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
He is not at home.

146
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Alisa, you look through this glass as the sun shrinks.

147
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
The skunk just said that you had gone fishing.

148
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
With the roof.

149
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
He's a tough talker.

150
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Moominpapa, the weather seems to be clearing up.

151
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
I would say something else.

152
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
The clouds disappeared as if by magic.

153
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:04,560
Ocean rushes to do and the power is pushed.

154
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:08,500
It flickered when the permission locations were searched.

155
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:10,500
Ehschaftalaisilla pohjoisuvassa, North recommendations and explanation will be updated as soon as they arrive.

156
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:12,500
Oh, pull up theuttering cable!

157
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:14,500
Haha.

158
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:16,500
Oh dear god!

159
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:18,500
Oh god direction, one, two, three.

160
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:20,500
A little further and Sequakes!

161
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:22,500
zostaa lhy Mansion!

162
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:24,500
Aaaah!

163
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:28,500
O like this!

164
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:30,500
Oh damn!

165
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:31,500
Wake up!

166
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:36,500
The wind blew my hat too.

167
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:39,500
Let's go inside and have a look. It's too windy.

168
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:41,500
What about papa?

169
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:45,500
Papa will come when he's got his hat on.

170
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:51,500
Oh! The other side of the sun is splitting.

171
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:58,500
Lovely. I don't really like the dark. It's terrifying.

172
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:01,500
Wake up!

173
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:08,500
Wake up!

174
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:10,500
Tehuusikohan.

175
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:18,500
I feel that the charms have been short-lived.

176
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:26,500
Oops! I'm super cool.

177
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:32,500
Oh!

178
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:36,500
The solar eclipse is important to grandma.

179
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:38,500
He gets more power from it.

180
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:43,500
Grandma was terribly angry when the clouds didn't seem to disappear at all.

181
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:48,500
Now grandma's spells have become really cool. Right, Alisa?

182
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:51,500
Well, at least he seems to think.

183
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:55,500
I don't think that a darkened sun can have an effect.

184
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:57,500
I don't dare, little one.

185
00:11:57,500 --> 00:11:58,500
Joo.

186
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:01,500
Wake up!

187
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:07,500
Alisa! Alisa!

188
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:10,500
where are you from

189
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:14,500
Alisa! Alisa!

190
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:19,500
Come on broom, don't worry about the wind rushing to the Moomin house to save, Alisa!

191
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:28,500
Toward the wind, obey the broom!

192
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:31,500
You're the curitor, you can't!

193
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:32,500
Wake up!

194
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:35,500
Wake up!

195
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:37,500
Wake up!

196
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:39,500
Wake up!

197
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:41,500
Wake up!

198
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:43,500
You're the curitor, you can't!

199
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:09,500
Now I'll catch you.

200
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:14,500
I will now show that you are a real witch's broom.

201
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:17,500
This is how it is flown.

202
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:31,500
Have you been to my room before?

203
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:32,500
Joo.

204
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:35,500
A couple of times I went in through the window.

205
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:36,500
Time-honored crush!

206
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:38,500
What are you doing here?

207
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:42,500
You were downstairs playing cards with Nikikenen and Nipsu.

208
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:45,500
One plays badly and the other cheats!

209
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:49,500
Come and see, you can see the bridge from here.

210
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:54,500
What?

211
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:06,500
Stink! It really is a skunk!

212
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:07,500
No!

213
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:12,500
Hi! I'm going to blow a broom!

214
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:16,500
Hi! Stink! Where did you get the broom?

215
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:18,500
I found in the forest.

216
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:19,500
Where from there?

217
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:21,500
Hope it helps later.

218
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:23,500
What can I do?

219
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:27,500
I don't know, I'll try to figure something out from here.

220
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:30,500
Doesn't the broom obey?

221
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:34,500
No, I can steer it a bit, but I don't know how to get down.

222
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:36,500
Oh well, sleep.

223
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:38,500
I can't hang around here anymore.

224
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:41,500
ha I Su Li!

225
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:43,500
Tell me about it below!

226
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:55,500
Stink, you said you could direct a little.

227
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:56,500
Joo!

228
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:58,500
Then direct here.

229
00:14:58,500 --> 00:14:59,500
Yeah, what?

230
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:01,500
Aim above the bed.

231
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:04,500
Good idea, I'll do that.

232
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:07,500
Ai!

233
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:12,500
Oh heaven!

234
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:15,500
I stank, no wonder.

235
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:18,500
Hey, let go of the broom.

236
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:26,500
It didn't happen to you.

237
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:27,500
No.

238
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:30,500
You flew on Aliisa's grandmother's broom.

239
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:31,500
So I flew.

240
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:32,500
Well, where are those?

241
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:35,500
Kicks his feet in the air in fists.

242
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:37,500
The wind knocked him off the broom.

243
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:40,500
Terrible, where is grandma?

244
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:42,500
Come and show me.

245
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:47,500
Have fun with free movement!

246
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:49,500
Up, up.

247
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:57,500
Over there!

248
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:01,500
Grandma!

249
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:04,500
Can I leave?

250
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:06,500
Out of breath huh?

251
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:08,500
No, just unconscious.

252
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:10,500
I'll carry him to us.

253
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:12,500
Now I'm disappearing.

254
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:14,500
Oh grandma dear.

255
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:17,500
Don't worry, mommy has a cure for that too.

256
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:19,500
Nobody cares about me.

257
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:36,500
Moominma, is grandma going to get better for sure?

258
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:39,500
Of course, I will cook him a tasty broth.

259
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:51,500
Grandma!

260
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:53,500
Is the witch still unconscious?

261
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:54,500
On.

262
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:57,500
I wouldn't have thought that a witch would slip on a broomstick.

263
00:16:57,500 --> 00:16:59,500
Solar eclipses were of no use.

264
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:01,500
How is Aliisa?

265
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:03,500
Is this out of concern?

266
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:07,500
That's how a blow could prepare a parachute for the witch.

267
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:19,500
Oh grandma!

268
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:21,500
Where am I?

269
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:23,500
In the Moomin house!

270
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:25,500
Moomin...

271
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:27,500
In the Moomin house!

272
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:31,500
You've hurt your back, stay in bed!

273
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:34,500
What has happened to me?

274
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:38,500
Guess where it is? This is my bone.

275
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:42,500
It won't come down because your spell is affecting it.

276
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:48,500
Hilppati, happati, silmati, sossistu, broom alaset.

277
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:50,500
Now we're going home.

278
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:51,500
Can you get up?

279
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:53,500
Well, of course.

280
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:55,500
You have to stay long.

281
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:57,500
Witches don't lie down.

282
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:04,500
Tolerable.

283
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:09,500
To end up in a Moomin house of all places in the world.

284
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:12,500
Moominpapa carried you the whole way.

285
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:17,500
Don't add to my pain, this is already humiliating enough.

286
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:21,500
I don't always eat their wacky crap.

287
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:29,500
Are you sure your grandma doesn't want to eat anything?

288
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:32,500
Yes, even though Liemi looked so nice.

289
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:34,500
He is too depressed.

290
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:39,500
Maybe he needs a spider's web as a seasoning.

291
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:42,500
You said I don't want to eat.

292
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:45,500
I don't want food or drink.

293
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:47,500
Grandma, grandma wants.

294
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:49,500
I want to eat.

295
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:51,500
You said I don't want to eat.

296
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:53,500
I don't want food or drink.

297
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:56,500
Grandma, Grandma wants the best for you.

298
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:57,500
Wait a minute.

299
00:18:57,500 --> 00:19:01,500
Would it be possible to taste vaapukka juice after all?

300
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:03,500
Let me be.

301
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:20,500
Grandma!

302
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:22,500
Now I'm going home.

303
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:23,500
Lying down will be enough.

304
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:25,500
Are you healthy yet?

305
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:27,500
Scratch the frog, maiti will heal me.

306
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:29,500
What about me?

307
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:31,500
You go to sleep.

308
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:33,500
Grandma!

309
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:35,500
I want to eat.

310
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:37,500
I want to eat.

311
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:39,500
I want to eat.

312
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:41,500
I want to eat.

313
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:43,500
I want to eat.

314
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:45,500
I want to eat.

315
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:47,500
I want to eat.

316
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:49,500
Grandma!

317
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:58,500
I have to thank the Moomins for taking care of me Teese.

318
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:02,500
Oh, and have fun with them.

319
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:04,500
Grandma!

320
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:07,500
Moomins are for witches.

321
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:27,500
For the first time, Alisa could play with the children of the Moomin house without feeling bad about herself.
