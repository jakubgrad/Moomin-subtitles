1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Theater advertisements flew over mountains and valleys.

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Wedding!

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Look!

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Advertisements also flew into the water.

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Paralyzed what?

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
There is some writing on the slip.

7
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
It's a manual program.

8
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
The Moomin Theater presents a play written by Moominpapa.

9
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Moomin papa?

10
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:46,000
The missing children. Starring Moominpappa, Moominamma, Nipsu with Emma as a guest star.

11
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Yes, Emma. She is my dear aunt.

12
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,000
And the entrance fee is anything edible.

13
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
They are putting on a play.

14
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
You in the theater?

15
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
The last time I went to the theater was as a little boy.

16
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:10,000
That play was about a princess who slept in a rose bush.

17
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
I have to get to the theater.

18
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
But who guards these lawbreakers at that time?

19
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I have a good suggestion for you to consider.

20
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Take us to the theater.

21
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Great idea.

22
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I promise and swear that we won't try to run away.

23
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
No.

24
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:36,000
You won't get out of jail until you write that 5,000 times it's forbidden.

25
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
It's punishment for your bad behavior in the park.

26
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
That means you can't see the play.

27
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
I don't give a damn about it, even though it's about a princess.

28
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
No, I'm going.

29
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
With us?

30
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
No, you stay here.

31
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
In that case, you stay too.

32
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
I'm going to the theater.

33
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Doesn't sound good. This scene needs to be rewritten.

34
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Moominpapa, I want to play more than a lion's rear end.

35
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
After all, you also have another role.

36
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
I played a barking baby.

37
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
You didn't want any dialogue.

38
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Emma, please sweep up later.

39
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Is the play not finished?

40
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Gotta start practicing or next night will go under the bench.

41
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
The play is about to be finished, Pika.

42
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
I'm halfway there.

43
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
There's no way I'll finish it in time.

44
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,000
It's the same for me. The curtain opens anyway.

45
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Write as many turns as possible for Emma.

46
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
He hugs to get on stage.

47
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
All right.

48
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Mamma, could you leave me alone now?

49
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
I am approaching the climax of the play.

50
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
I have my own doubts about the play.

51
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,000
I'll replace them when the show is over.

52
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:59,000
The play describes how a couple of children get lost from their parents.

53
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Does it necessarily require the rear end of a lion?

54
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Mamma, I'll keep Nipsu out of my sight.

55
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Pinch. Let's go practice our roles.

56
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:13,000
The play will be good if papa leaves out the rear end of the lion.

57
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
There's more to it than the rear end.

58
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
The lion's head half is also included.

59
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:23,000
The lion is absolutely necessary in the play written by grandma papa.

60
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
A whole lion!

61
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Here is Sell's key.

62
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Keep an eye on the prisoners until I return. Did you understand?

63
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Yeah. Do they swirl?

64
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000
That's fine. If you let them escape.

65
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Police uncle, who is he?

66
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:49,000
My cousin. He does exactly what I tell him to do.

67
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Well, I'm going to the theater now.

68
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Obey my cousin.

69
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Hey listen, you knit beautifully.

70
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Thanks.

71
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
First time someone compliments my knitting.

72
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
What are you knitting?

73
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
I don't know what will come of this yet.

74
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,000
It's funny, of course, but it's a little fun for me.

75
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
It's a little fun for me.

76
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
It's a little fun for me.

77
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
It's a little fun for me.

78
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:29,000
It's funny, of course, but it makes me feel safe to listen to the life of the sticks.

79
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:33,000
The only difficulty is that I just knit and knit.

80
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:38,000
And before I've decided what to knit, I'm already terribly far along.

81
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,000
And you can't knit slippers, for example?

82
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Slippers?

83
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Yes, when that color is so cute for slippers.

84
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
A surprising suggestion.

85
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:55,000
If I knit you all slippers,

86
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,000
do you put your feet up?

87
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Of course.

88
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:05,000
I want slippers. It's so cold here that I'm dying.

89
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Is it so cold now?

90
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:12,000
There is. I can barely speak through this chest.

91
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Oh my god, what am I going to do now.

92
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Maybe the tea collects the wine jelly better than slippers.

93
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Before it's too late.

94
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,000
My cousin probably won't like this, but...

95
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
But what?

96
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,000
I would love to invite you to warm my home.

97
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Fits!

98
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Also little picture, don't cry little one.

99
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
wall

100
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Mamma, mamma, more feeling.

101
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Close the popsicle stick again.

102
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,000
This baby weighs an awful lot.

103
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
How do I act?

104
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Excellent. I have absolutely nothing to fix.

105
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
I could have played a more talkative role.

106
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,000
It's funny that they did well this time.

107
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Now you can taste my best cookies.

108
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,000
The earlier ones also tasted good.

109
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
My stomach is completely.

110
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
So does mine.

111
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
You are a flour thumb.

112
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Would you like more tea? I have a lot of grape juice.

113
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:09,000
No thanks. We have pink bellies. Can't fit anything anymore.

114
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Unfortunately.

115
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000
I miss you. Are we leaving?

116
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Of course.

117
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:22,000
It saddens me that I have to put you in prison again.

118
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:27,000
I'm sad to report, but we're not going back to jail.

119
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Oh, why don't you?

120
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:34,000
We are going to the theater to see Moominmamma and Moominpapa.

121
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:38,000
And I absolutely must meet my old aunt.

122
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Oh, my Cousin is guaranteed to have a blast.

123
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:46,000
We haven't done anything illegal.

124
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Don't you?

125
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:53,000
We really don't. Why would we have put up prohibition signs in the park?

126
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:57,000
We just burned the wreckage brought by the water in the midsummer fire.

127
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:02,000
But when we told your Cousin about it, he arrested us.

128
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Why didn't you say that earlier?

129
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:09,000
You don't have to go to jail if you haven't broken the law.

130
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Can we go to the theater now?

131
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Without further ado, leave now. My cousin was disappointed, but it can't be helped.

132
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Hey, wait. I'll come along and tell my Cousin,

133
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:27,000
that you have not committed any violations.

134
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:35,000
All right. Come on, Moominpapa. Stop! About.

135
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Next scene. Mom, what have you found?

136
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Cradle. I would like to put it into a play. OK, papa?

137
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Moominpapa! Moominpapa! I just read the script.

138
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Who will play these roles when Moomin and Niiskunnet are missing?

139
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:59,000
I don't know. We don't have any more children, and the baby is not suitable.

140
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:03,000
You are nuts! The show is only a few hours away.

141
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:07,000
You don't get anyone to play children. How can a family be reunited?

142
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:11,000
It can't be helped. We are so short staffed.

143
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:15,000
I hope all the critics have fallen.

144
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Hold on. Now let's go.

145
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Moon now. You can make noise for a while, but you have to be quiet in the theater.

146
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Whisper shut up.

147
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Are you ready? Let's get started!

148
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for giving up your valuable time and coming to see our show.

149
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Tonight's play is called Lost Children.

150
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:23,000
The play has not been performed anywhere before.

151
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
What the hell is that?

152
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Cradle, it's for you.

153
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:32,000
No! We hope you enjoy our show until the end.

154
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Let's start already!

155
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Cheers, cheers!

156
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Thanks!

157
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Huys, huys, little picture.

158
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
You can't take a walk.

159
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Hush, hush.

160
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Moomin, Goblin, Nisku, Miss, my dear children.

161
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:03,000
It's been a long time since you disappeared like tin hair.

162
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
He has forgotten me!

163
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:11,000
My heart has sunk to the bottom of the dark ocean.

164
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:18,000
From what I hear, don't let sadness take over your mind.

165
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Children, come back home.

166
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Save my heart from the fields of sorrow.

167
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Can you hear how this sweet little one misses you?

168
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Is he barking?

169
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
With a better voice.

170
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,000
I feel bad.

171
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
What's wrong with you?

172
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Don't freak out, I'm going to throw up.

173
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Have you become seasick?

174
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,000
From what I hear, let's go find the children.

175
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
What about our baby?

176
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,000
We can ask someone to babysit.

177
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
We won't be long.

178
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Approximately how long?

179
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
A month, a year.

180
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Until fortune once again agrees to smile on us.

181
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
You can cut it.

182
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
You'll be fine.

183
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Yeah, but...

184
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
The second show begins.

185
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Help, I'm stuck in the cradle.

186
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
When will the princess appear?

187
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Do we still have a long way to go?

188
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
There is. Hurry Moomin, Goblin.

189
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
I'll try.

190
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
It is forbidden.

191
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
What do you write?

192
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
My cousin is an acorn.

193
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,000
I'll write five times just in case.

194
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,000
It's forbidden, it's forbidden, it's forbidden.

195
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
What do you write?

196
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
My cousin is an acorn.

197
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
I'll write five times just in case.

198
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:53,000
It's forbidden, it's forbidden, it's forbidden.

199
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,000
We left home already two weeks ago.

200
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Frighteningly cold.

201
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:04,000
How are the children's leftovers doing in this weather.

202
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Oh my darling, what happened to you?

203
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Sprained ankle.

204
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Oh Koske.

205
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
We're in trouble.

206
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Wolves howl in the mountains.

207
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
I'll argue.

208
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
It won't work.

209
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
How did this happen to you?

210
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Pumimama hugged me to help me.

211
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Please help, I'm just trying a child parka.

212
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:32,000
A lion cannot step onto the stage without its tail.

213
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
It's already late in the evening.

214
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,000
I suggest we stay here for the night.

215
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Do we dare? I feel in my bones that something terrible is going to happen tomorrow.

216
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:51,000
I smell our innocent blood lurking in the hideous beasts.

217
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:56,000
I hear hungry beasts howling somewhere.

218
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:02,000
I hear the howling of hungry beasts.

219
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,000
I hear the lion roar.

220
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Hey.

221
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Oh shit.

222
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Papa, where are you going?

223
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Oh you. I have to go.

224
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:27,000
I have to go tell that goddamn lion to take the stage.

225
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Don't worry. I'll be right back.

226
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Did he say the right words?

227
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Hey, are you going to spoil my play?

228
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
I did take care of my share.

229
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Mamma is climbing on stage.

230
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
A roaring lion.

231
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:48,000
The lion roared again. Where does my husband stay?

232
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Both on stage suddenly.

233
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,000
I can't. I'm going to throw up.

234
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Muunipappa, what are you going to do?

235
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Go to the lava on the cradle.

236
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Not usually laughing. Don't make me laugh.

237
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Nobody knows you.

238
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Help the lion. Are you going to eat me?

239
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Don't be silly, laugh.

240
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Muunipappa.

241
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Oh, the whole lion eat muunipammas.

242
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Help, what should I do? What does it have in mind?

243
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Run away. Run across the stage.

244
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Our he wore a shirt together.

245
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:58,000
The situation has changed. I will save you at the right time.

246
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Help.

247
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Help, help.

248
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:12,000
I'm not quiet, I'm going fast. I'm going to die.

249
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
Help, help me.

250
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Daddy, hurry up.

251
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
I'll come to the rescue.

252
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Help.

253
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Oops, a snap.

254
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Glad you're alive.

255
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Were you worried about me?

256
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Of course I was. I could have forgotten you before.

257
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Mom, hello mom.

258
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
It is.

259
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Me here, Moomin.

260
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
And me, scumbag.

261
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Father, mother.

262
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Moomin and the snotty lady.

263
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Come closer so I can see your face.

264
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
We came back.

265
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
I've missed you.

266
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Glad you found us.

267
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
Oh, Viljaana.

268
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Oh, Aunt Emma.

269
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Oh, you look grown.

270
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Oh, it was a shame that I didn't manage to see the show here at all.

271
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,000
It was indeed a fine play.

272
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:36,000
Snuff, I've missed you.

273
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
Me too you.

274
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:43,000
Young criminals have escaped from prison.

275
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
Catch them.

276
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:50,000
No, no, I let the prisoners out of the cell because they are innocent.

277
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,000
They did not tear down the prohibition boards.

278
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:57,000
That's right, I'll tear down all the prohibition signs from the park.

279
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
And I was involved.

280
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
In that case, I'll keep you.

281
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:04,000
No, no, no, no.

282
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
Those kids are crazy.

283
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
Talk, please.

284
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:12,000
It is forbidden, it is forbidden.

285
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
Five thousand times is forbidden.

286
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,000
Surely there are five thousand times in it?

287
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
I swear by the rock and the stake.

288
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,000
One, two, three, four.

289
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:28,000
Now that the whole family is together again, I miss Moomin Valley.

290
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,000
Well, dare to smile, what are we going to do to these children?

291
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:34,000
Yeah, I'd like to hear opinions for once.

292
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,000
I can take care of them.

293
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
Is that you?

294
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:45,000
Now that I have stage experience, I could train new Actors for the theater.

295
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:49,000
Good idea, am I too old?

296
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
Character for roles maybe.

297
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
Everything is fine.

298
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:56,000
Well, are we heading home late?

299
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,000
I'm coming home too, don't forget me!

300
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:02,000
Keep your mouth shut!

301
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,000
My math got messed up.

302
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:08,000
Dad, we have to thank the viewers.

303
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:12,000
They are still sitting there.

304
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Sure enough.

305
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:19,000
Ladies and gentlemen, this is the end of the play written by Moominpapa

306
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:24,000
Thank you for staying with us until the end.

307
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:40,000
It all started with the eruption of an underwater volcano.

308
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,000
After all, the eruption is already over.

309
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:48,000
Listen mom, what would you say if I wrote more plays?

310
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:53,000
Just write. You also have gifts as a playwright.

311
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
Really.

312
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:59,000
Start a new play as soon as we get to the rest of the valley.

313
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:07,000
The house looks the same, but I guess it's quite a mess inside.

314
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
I have to do a big cleaning.

315
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
You are right.

316
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
You guys are helping me.

317
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
Joo.

318
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:23,000
For the rest of the week, everyone was trying to remember where each rug or piece of furniture had been.
