1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,000
The day looked calm. It felt and even smelled calm, but it turned out to be anything but calm.

2
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Today's lie in a hammock.

3
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Good morning.

4
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Little sell, good morning.

5
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
You seem satisfied with your life.

6
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I am too. The housework is done and after breakfast I throw myself in the hammock. I listen to birdsong and maybe take a nap.

7
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Moominpapa has the same guarantees.

8
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
So be it, but I'm going to make it first.

9
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
I will help you. I'm fighting papa.

10
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
It's hardly necessary.

11
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Who comes this early?

12
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Good morning.

13
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Oh my sister!

14
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Hey mymmeli!

15
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Are you here already? Well, one child you here.

16
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Oh what do you mean? Don't belittle me!

17
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Good morning, sorry to bother you.

18
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Nothing can disturb me today. Does the coffee taste good?

19
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Thanks.

20
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Go to the bottom. You look worried.

21
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
I'm in dire straits.

22
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
What is it?

23
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
My mother came to visit unexpectedly.

24
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
What concern is that?

25
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Mom didn't come alone.

26
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
But with my sister and brother.

27
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
There are a lot of them.

28
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
I don't understand how I can fit them in my little house.

29
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,000
No sweat. Let's invite them here. We have a lot of rooms.

30
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Well, the little one already lives with you.

31
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
I could take him home.

32
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Myi is part of the family. There's nothing to worry about, mumbled.

33
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Moominpapa!

34
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Bring the cat anytime?

35
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Well, to be honest, they're already waiting behind the door.

36
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Let's let them in.

37
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
What amount?

38
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Be tidy guys!

39
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Hey mom!

40
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Hello alte.

41
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Welcome to Muuni House.

42
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Little baby, you've grown up.

43
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Mom, can I have Moominpapa and Moominma on the flyers?

44
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
I hear you can stay here.

45
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
I hope there aren't too many of us.

46
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
It's just fun.

47
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
I hope you have a good time with us. Make yourself at home.

48
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Sot canteens in bills. How in the world has my life blessed you?

49
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
There should be ten of them, unless I've missed someone.

50
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
It's hard to keep them together.

51
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Or ten? You'd think there would be more.

52
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Someone is sleeping here.

53
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Fun! And the sheath!

54
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Here is something big and round.

55
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
I'm dreaming.

56
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Many to sell, what a nightmare.

57
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
I can't even dream.

58
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Hey, get those crooks out of my face.

59
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Wait a minute!

60
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Ah, I caught it.

61
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Good mummy!

62
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Hey, who are these rascals?

63
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Good morning mummy.

64
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Who are these horrible brats?

65
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Unfortunately for my siblings, they stay here.

66
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
What for?

67
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Oh, it's so peaceful here.

68
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Children have quite a workplace.

69
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
I let them be free.

70
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Yeah, I totally understand.

71
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Sometimes I have to intervene in fights.

72
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Come on, how?

73
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
You won't take it from me.

74
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Just take a minute.

75
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
For example like this.

76
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
did you see

77
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Joo.

78
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Mother, mother.

79
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
That too.

80
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Moomin, you there?

81
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Mom, what are those wild trolls?

82
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
They are sales fields and sister series.

83
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Will you help to slice?

84
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
What's wrong?

85
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
The kids were here for a while.

86
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
They probably had fun.

87
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
I also sell too thick ones from relatives.

88
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Be patient.

89
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
They are only staying here for a day.

90
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
It is not certain whether their house collapsed.

91
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
What are you whining about?

92
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Collapsed like a house of cards.

93
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
The walls couldn't take the games of these idiots anymore.

94
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Don't they have anywhere to go?

95
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Apparently not.

96
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Mom, the kids like the Moomin house because it's much bigger than their old house.

97
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Yes, and it's still standing.

98
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
A little nugget.

99
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Let's be nice to them.

100
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Let's try at least.

101
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Is it clear mummy?

102
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
I'm terribly tired.

103
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
This is my bed.

104
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Go your way.

105
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
We like this.

106
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Doesn't move me.

107
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
And not another bed.

108
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
There's one more here.

109
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Little sells.

110
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Kiisee, little sister and that's why I came here.

111
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
I need rest sometimes too.

112
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Don't laugh.

113
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,000
I couldn't sleep for a moment and now I'm shaking everywhere.

114
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Oh, the little rascals from them have fallen home.

115
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
My foot scraper.

116
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
I can't stand another night like that.

117
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
You happy live alone.

118
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Well, move out of the house.

119
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Me?

120
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
You could build your own house.

121
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,000
I have no idea about construction.

122
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
How do you know you've never tried?

123
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
You don't just build a house like that.

124
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Most houses are built.

125
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Wouldn't it be great to own your own house and wouldn't it be fun to snitch?

126
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
I don't even know where to start.

127
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Your father has built a Moomin house.

128
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
He has books on the subject.

129
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Dad's?

130
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
It sure is.

131
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
That's what I want.

132
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Not bad.

133
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Myy.

134
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Do you want to build a house?

135
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Joo.

136
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Your beastly sisterly brothers have been spinning around my legs all day.

137
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
I would like to live alone.

138
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
I'll be a helper.

139
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Thanks.

140
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,000
The book says that a house starts with the cornerstone.

141
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
There are suitable stones there.

142
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
These are fine.

143
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Oh.

144
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Terribly heavy.

145
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Don't get caught up in it.

146
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Hey.

147
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
What? Now this is olevida.

148
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
I didn't realize it was your home.

149
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Sorry, stinky.

150
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
The saw thing.

151
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Myy.

152
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Enter a new one.

153
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
How many saws do you need for one frame?

154
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Everyone seems to be stuck in the middle.

155
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
It's the last saw.

156
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
What do they have in mind?

157
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Hey.

158
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Now.

159
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Hey.

160
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Pumi Troll Are you trying to crush bones?

161
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Aha.

162
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
The cornerstones are gone.

163
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
You haven't moved them.

164
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Of course not.

165
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
You have moved them.

166
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Build it yourself.

167
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Myy.

168
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
You hurt me.

169
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
I'm going home.

170
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Oh.

171
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Goodbye.

172
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Good to go.

173
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,000
I build a house without anyone's help.

174
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Oh.

175
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Be careful.

176
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Oh.

177
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Will you stay intact?

178
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Boomerang.

179
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Dammit girl.

180
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
I fancy.

181
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Nuuska muikkuinen told me that you are building a house.

182
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
I am.

183
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
What a wonderful surprise.

184
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Our common house.

185
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Otherwise, I have a different night snack.

186
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Now I'll leave you alone to work.

187
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Dammit girl.

188
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Thanks.

189
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
It won't last.

190
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,000
I imagined that Miss Niisku would have come to help.

191
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:02,000
When the house is ready, I will make fun of the people who come into the house.

192
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Haa.

193
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Good morning, Pumipeikka.

194
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Have breakfast for you.

195
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Ah, morning.

196
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Sell, now I don't need help anymore.

197
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Do you remember the job well?

198
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
The roof is just missing.

199
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Pumipeikko, where is the door and windows?

200
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Oh yes, the door and windows.

201
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
We are often built from behind.

202
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Is that a door?

203
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
The door is a bit of the wrong cocaine.

204
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
At least it's not tight.

205
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Why is there a track here?

206
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
You can get through it.

207
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Uh, just thank you.

208
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,000
But I always wonder if there is a door and windows?

209
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
There isn't.

210
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Is there a door and windows?

211
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Is there a door and windows?

212
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Is there a door and windows?

213
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Is there a door and windows?

214
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,000
But I could have passed under the door.

215
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
It rained.

216
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
And I haven't done the roof yet.

217
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,000
I run to get some kind of tarp.

218
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
I'll help with the roofing.

219
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,000
It would be better to do this on a rainy day.

220
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Sell, hold tight.

221
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Sell, how do you cope?

222
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Very.

223
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Is the door and roof starting to fall into place?

224
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Is the roof really in place?

225
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
On, on.

226
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
But the skylight leaks.

227
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Oh, you have one too.

228
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
It's a little chilly here.

229
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,000
I think you need to build a furnace.

230
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Tuuskamuikkunen. Tuuskamuikkunen.

231
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Hi, I'm on the roof.

232
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
It's almost ready here.

233
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Yeah. Horrible.

234
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Oh, Moomin, the chimney is crooked.

235
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Look.

236
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,000
I refuse. I like it this way.

237
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:38,000
It balances the house nicely.

238
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Thoughtful thing.

239
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Really?

240
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Oh, boys.

241
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
A very unusual house.

242
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
What is this needed for?

243
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
I'm waiting for a while. I'm coming down.

244
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Joo.

245
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Well, what do you think? It's really easy to get down.

246
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:06,000
But how do you get from downstairs to upstairs?

247
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:10,000
Yes, when I haven't built whores.

248
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
I had a brilliant idea.

249
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Do you mean diga trees?

250
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:18,000
I don't. Much more fun. Leave it to me.

251
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Lyy, is it ready?

252
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Of course it is.

253
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
Well, not difficult at all.

254
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
It isn't.

255
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:42,000
It isn't. For one as small as you.

256
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,000
But how do I get here?

257
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
That was the last nail.

258
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
Well, now the house is ready.

259
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:54,000
Oh, looks a bit strange.

260
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Look, mom and dad have to be invited to watch.

261
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
I guess so then.

262
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
Joo.

263
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
Six.

264
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Six.

265
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
What, either the house is ready?

266
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
Good luck, Moomin.

267
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Now wait until you see it first.

268
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
Let's take a look right away.

269
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Let's go away.

270
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
Is it okay if I come along?

271
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:36,000
Of course. Where are the gold nuggets?

272
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
True indeed.

273
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,000
Well, they must be playing outside.

274
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
Hopefully.

275
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:58,000
There you are and everything is saved.

276
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,000
Dwarf-sized monsters come out from under me.

277
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
Please wait.

278
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
I'm next.

279
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:26,000
This is not an amusement park.

280
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:32,000
I have never seen my children so happy.

281
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
Moomin has been clever.

282
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
Verily.

283
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,000
What?

284
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:41,000
Would Moomipeikko let you live here when you get a new house?

285
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
Would it work out?

286
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
Moomin, do you agree?

287
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:49,000
Of course. Then I could move back home.

288
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:54,000
Oh thank you, Moomin. You have a great son.

289
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,000
Well, he happens to be a natural-born nigger.

290
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:18,000
I'm kind of glad we didn't have to live in your house.

291
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,000
Sometimes.

292
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,000
So.

293
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,000
I will build us a good house.

294
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:27,000
Oh great. That's where I want to live.
