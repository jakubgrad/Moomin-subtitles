00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:07,060
There will be a big six with them.

5
00:01:12,260 --> 00:01:15,220
What does Noide have in mind now?

6
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:20,900
Now I Tajo this family enchants the darlings to sleep,

7
00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:25,060
I'm going to sleep, to sleep for a while,

8
00:01:25,060 --> 00:01:29,380
so that you wouldn't wake up on a moonlit day and fall,

9
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:35,380
I was scared, I was scared, I was laughing, I was squirming, I was crazy, whoa!

10
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:41,380
Oh, the nose is trying again, even though there are stones in the ear.

11
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:45,380
Hope!

12
00:01:59,380 --> 00:02:01,380
It looks like spring.

13
00:02:05,380 --> 00:02:07,380
Moomin Valley also wakes up from sleep.

14
00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:16,380
Spring is in the air.

15
00:02:18,380 --> 00:02:20,380
Wake up!

16
00:02:20,380 --> 00:02:22,380
This looks like a new species.

17
00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:31,380
Good morning, Hemuli.

18
00:02:32,380 --> 00:02:34,380
Nipsu, you're in the early stages.

19
00:02:35,380 --> 00:02:37,380
Yeah, I woke up before the Moomin.

20
00:02:38,380 --> 00:02:40,380
So, I haven't seen a Moomin yet.

21
00:02:41,380 --> 00:02:43,380
I haven't seen a Moomin.

22
00:02:44,380 --> 00:02:46,380
I haven't seen a Moomin.

23
00:02:46,380 --> 00:02:48,380
I haven't seen a Moomin.

24
00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:51,380
I haven't seen a Moomin.

25
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:01,380
Moomin wakes up, spring has come.

26
00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:04,380
Moomin!

27
00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:07,380
Come on, it's easier for my mother to wake up.

28
00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:10,380
I'm not getting wet!

29
00:03:11,380 --> 00:03:13,380
And I thought it was hard to wake me up.

30
00:03:13,380 --> 00:03:15,380
Cool sleeping bags!

31
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:27,380
Dude, what are you doing?

32
00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:30,380
Oh what, use your eyes.

33
00:03:31,380 --> 00:03:33,380
Idiot, why are you playing on a ladder?

34
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:36,380
Well, when Moomin and Snow Maiden have to be woken up.

35
00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:39,380
Why don't you use the stairs?

36
00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:45,380
No one seems to be awake yet.

37
00:03:47,380 --> 00:03:49,380
No one seems to be awake yet.

38
00:03:55,380 --> 00:03:57,380
Let's sleep.

39
00:04:09,380 --> 00:04:11,380
Moomin and the rain mother, wake up.

40
00:04:11,380 --> 00:04:13,380
It's spring now!

41
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:16,380
Oh you! Moomin!

42
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:19,380
A fat loess too! Wake-up!

43
00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:22,380
Strange behavior even from a Moomin.

44
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:27,380
Yy open the window!

45
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:37,380
Huh, I missed you.

46
00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:40,380
Why haven't you woken them up?

47
00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:43,380
No life.

48
00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:46,380
From Heps.

49
00:04:48,380 --> 00:04:50,380
This trick always works.

50
00:04:51,380 --> 00:04:53,380
Wake up Moomin, I know you're tickling.

51
00:04:57,380 --> 00:04:59,380
Moomin, wake up already!

52
00:05:00,380 --> 00:05:02,380
Hopeless!

53
00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:14,380
Kutkutkut!

54
00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:17,380
He won't wake up.

55
00:05:18,380 --> 00:05:20,380
Remarkable.

56
00:05:21,380 --> 00:05:23,380
Just don't say.

57
00:05:24,380 --> 00:05:26,380
You can't scare me.

58
00:05:27,380 --> 00:05:29,380
It's okay, hear how the heart beats.

59
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:33,380
He breathes.

60
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:36,380
I'm not the mother of the storm.

61
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:40,380
Wake-up! Sleepyhead!

62
00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:43,380
I'm not getting wet!

63
00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:45,380
They don't wake up.

64
00:05:45,380 --> 00:05:47,380
Curious thing.

65
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:49,380
Mätänt mom and dad?

66
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:51,380
Shall we go wake up?

67
00:05:51,380 --> 00:05:53,380
I can't stand it when others sleep while I'm awake.

68
00:05:53,380 --> 00:05:55,380
Although the opposite is not good at all.

69
00:05:59,380 --> 00:06:01,380
Moominpapa, don't sleep.

70
00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:03,380
Moomin can't be woken up with an axe.

71
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:06,380
Wake up, Moomin! It's already breakfast.

72
00:06:06,380 --> 00:06:08,380
Well, Moominpapa.

73
00:06:08,380 --> 00:06:10,380
I'm starving.

74
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:12,380
No progress.

75
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:22,380
We're just still hibernating here.

76
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:24,380
Yes, and the eiti of Niskuk is also sleeping.

77
00:06:24,380 --> 00:06:26,380
Well, that's weird.

78
00:06:26,380 --> 00:06:28,380
He always wakes up before me.

79
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:30,380
Similarly, Moomin is usually more active than me.

80
00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:32,380
Well, that's fine.

81
00:06:32,380 --> 00:06:36,380
I'm going home and I'll come again to get the niisku eiti when we're awake here.

82
00:06:36,380 --> 00:06:38,380
If we are...

83
00:06:39,380 --> 00:06:44,380
We've done anything to make the Moomin goblins startle and wake up.

84
00:06:44,380 --> 00:06:47,380
Tickled, tickled, torn, ears pinched.

85
00:06:48,380 --> 00:06:51,380
This is so weird it's sickening.

86
00:06:51,380 --> 00:06:53,380
Oh, don't sleep.

87
00:06:54,380 --> 00:06:56,380
Day to the house.

88
00:06:56,380 --> 00:06:58,380
Remarkable going.

89
00:06:58,380 --> 00:07:00,380
We're still sleeping here, right?

90
00:07:04,380 --> 00:07:07,380
Yes, he does sleep.

91
00:07:09,380 --> 00:07:12,380
You are in such a sweet dream that...

92
00:07:14,380 --> 00:07:16,380
Wake up!

93
00:07:16,380 --> 00:07:17,380
Date?

94
00:07:17,380 --> 00:07:19,380
Sure enough.

95
00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:23,380
I guess we can't do anything but wait here.

96
00:07:23,380 --> 00:07:25,380
Probably not.

97
00:07:25,380 --> 00:07:27,380
There is no reason to worry.

98
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:30,380
The days are getting warmer, the Moomins will wake up soon.

99
00:07:30,380 --> 00:07:32,380
Niisku's mother too.

100
00:07:32,380 --> 00:07:34,380
Of course.

101
00:07:35,380 --> 00:07:38,380
The Moomin is guaranteed to wake up when the Snuff Muikkunen returns.

102
00:07:38,380 --> 00:07:40,380
Hear it!

103
00:07:42,380 --> 00:07:48,380
About a week later, Nuuska Muikkunen returned from his annual trip to the south.

104
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:06,380
Snuff Muikkunen!

105
00:08:06,380 --> 00:08:08,380
Snuff Muikkunen!

106
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:36,380
Ihihi!

107
00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:53,380
Where is Moomin?

108
00:08:53,380 --> 00:08:55,380
Still sleeping.

109
00:08:55,380 --> 00:08:57,380
Moomin sleeps like a log.

110
00:08:57,380 --> 00:08:59,380
Phooey.

111
00:09:05,380 --> 00:09:08,380
You can't wake them up with any lynx.

112
00:09:08,380 --> 00:09:10,380
What could be the cause?

113
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:12,380
Are they sick?

114
00:09:12,380 --> 00:09:14,380
Possibly.

115
00:09:14,380 --> 00:09:16,380
They have sleep sickness!

116
00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:18,380
This is not really my field.

117
00:09:18,380 --> 00:09:23,380
Somehow, it seems to me that Moomin and the mother of the storm are under a spell.

118
00:09:23,380 --> 00:09:24,380
Ihihi!

119
00:09:24,380 --> 00:09:26,380
Lumotto?

120
00:09:26,380 --> 00:09:27,380
But who?

121
00:09:27,380 --> 00:09:29,380
Oh, I know!

122
00:09:30,380 --> 00:09:34,380
You mean the witch, Alisa Mummo? Why?

123
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:36,380
I'm dreaming of something like that.

124
00:09:36,380 --> 00:09:38,380
How do we get through this?

125
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:42,380
I'm going to the forest to look for the witch.

126
00:09:42,380 --> 00:09:45,380
Do you think the witch will admit what she did?

127
00:09:45,380 --> 00:09:48,380
I don't know, but something has to be done.

128
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:51,380
We can't leave the Moomins sleeping forever.

129
00:09:52,380 --> 00:09:53,380
I'll come along!

130
00:09:53,380 --> 00:09:57,380
I better stay here to system things,

131
00:09:57,380 --> 00:09:59,380
if the Moomins suddenly wake up.

132
00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:02,380
Hello...

133
00:10:03,380 --> 00:10:04,380
Did you hear?

134
00:10:04,380 --> 00:10:05,380
He has woken up!

135
00:10:05,380 --> 00:10:06,380
Moomin!

136
00:10:06,380 --> 00:10:08,380
Moomin, wake up!

137
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:11,380
Change to Nissan!

138
00:10:12,380 --> 00:10:14,380
It makes me sleepy just looking at him.

139
00:10:17,380 --> 00:10:20,380
Listen, I will free you from the spell of the witch.

140
00:10:27,380 --> 00:10:28,380
Hey!

141
00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:50,380
About!

142
00:10:50,380 --> 00:10:52,380
are you going are you going

143
00:10:52,380 --> 00:10:56,380
I have done all the household chores and even washed the poison cans.

144
00:10:56,380 --> 00:10:58,380
But go you go?

145
00:10:58,380 --> 00:11:02,380
Now it's spring and I want to take some time off.

146
00:11:02,380 --> 00:11:04,380
Those are not lazy.

147
00:11:04,380 --> 00:11:06,380
I just go to Moominvalley.

148
00:11:06,380 --> 00:11:08,380
Ha, I guessed that.

149
00:11:08,380 --> 00:11:10,380
I want to meet the Moomins.

150
00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:12,380
Moomin sleeping?

151
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:14,380
He doesn't sleep, winter is already over.

152
00:11:14,380 --> 00:11:16,380
But the Moomins are still fast asleep.

153
00:11:16,380 --> 00:11:18,380
Grandma, how do you know that?

154
00:11:18,380 --> 00:11:20,380
The witch knows everything.

155
00:11:20,380 --> 00:11:22,380
Or so, I'll take care of that.

156
00:11:24,380 --> 00:11:26,380
Come back!

157
00:11:32,380 --> 00:11:34,380
I can't do anything about it, taking care of the house.

158
00:11:34,380 --> 00:11:36,380
I want to come back.

159
00:11:36,380 --> 00:11:38,380
Come back!

160
00:11:38,380 --> 00:11:40,380
Come back!

161
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:42,380
Come back!

162
00:11:42,380 --> 00:11:46,380
I can't do anything about it, I have to worry about mummies.

163
00:11:46,380 --> 00:11:48,380
I opened the window.

164
00:11:48,380 --> 00:11:50,380
Wisely done.

165
00:11:50,380 --> 00:11:52,380
Let them sniff.

166
00:11:52,380 --> 00:11:56,380
The smell of the first spring flowers.

167
00:12:00,380 --> 00:12:04,380
Why didn't you tell Hemul they were bewitched?

168
00:12:04,380 --> 00:12:06,380
Well, that's just an assumption.

169
00:12:06,380 --> 00:12:08,380
It would be disgusting if I were wrong.

170
00:12:08,380 --> 00:12:10,380
Don't tell about my suspicions.

171
00:12:10,380 --> 00:12:12,380
Alright, I'm leaving now.

172
00:12:14,380 --> 00:12:16,380
I'm going too!

173
00:12:22,380 --> 00:12:24,380
It's Alicia!

174
00:12:26,380 --> 00:12:28,380
Hello! What are you going to tell him?

175
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:30,380
Best to tell the truth.

176
00:12:40,380 --> 00:12:42,380
I'll say a few choice words to grandma.

177
00:12:42,380 --> 00:12:44,380
Tees se.

178
00:12:44,380 --> 00:12:46,380
Grandma has become impossible.

179
00:12:50,380 --> 00:12:52,380
Grandma, how could you be so mean?

180
00:12:52,380 --> 00:12:54,380
What's mean?

181
00:12:54,380 --> 00:12:56,380
I did it exclusively for you.

182
00:12:56,380 --> 00:12:58,380
I don't think so.

183
00:12:58,380 --> 00:13:00,380
That's fine.

184
00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:04,380
If the Moomins sleep with you, there's nothing wrong with them.

185
00:13:04,380 --> 00:13:06,380
Or so you imagine?

186
00:13:06,380 --> 00:13:08,380
You have made good progress in your studies as well.

187
00:13:08,380 --> 00:13:14,380
And if you keep going, you could become a flying witch before you turn 30.

188
00:13:14,380 --> 00:13:18,380
But if I meet Moomins, at 31, right?

189
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:20,380
You are a smart girl.

190
00:13:20,380 --> 00:13:26,380
The Moomins have a bad influence on you and are so annoying.

191
00:13:30,380 --> 00:13:36,380
Will you break the spell if I promise never to go to moominvalley again?

192
00:13:36,380 --> 00:13:41,380
That's right, kind girl, promise my girl.

193
00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:42,380
Well, I promise.

194
00:13:42,380 --> 00:13:44,380
Fine, I'll break the spell.

195
00:13:44,380 --> 00:13:46,380
Nuuska Muikkunen.

196
00:13:46,380 --> 00:13:47,380
What?

197
00:13:47,380 --> 00:13:50,380
There are two ways to remove the enchantment.

198
00:13:50,380 --> 00:13:56,380
Another way is for me to go to Moomin Valley myself and mumble a counterspell.

199
00:13:56,380 --> 00:13:57,380
Grandma!

200
00:13:57,380 --> 00:13:59,380
That it will work.

201
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:00,380
Oh, oh.

202
00:14:00,380 --> 00:14:04,380
So if they notice me, rumors will start circulating in Moomin Valley.

203
00:14:04,380 --> 00:14:10,380
Let's rather have Nuuska Muikkunen remove the enchantment on my side.

204
00:14:10,380 --> 00:14:12,380
Uh, me?

205
00:14:12,380 --> 00:14:14,380
Do you have a harmonica with you?

206
00:14:14,380 --> 00:14:15,380
Certain.

207
00:14:15,380 --> 00:14:17,380
Give it to me.

208
00:14:20,380 --> 00:14:28,380
Oh, I jogged, I kölketed, pilleren, pölleren, kespesu...

209
00:14:28,380 --> 00:14:31,380
My magic won't work if you're standing around pushing it.

210
00:14:31,380 --> 00:14:33,380
Alisa, you bring the pig to drink.

211
00:14:33,380 --> 00:14:35,380
Joo.

212
00:14:35,380 --> 00:14:38,380
Oh, how boring.

213
00:14:43,380 --> 00:14:48,380
I jogged, I jogged, or is it not allowed to stare?

214
00:14:51,380 --> 00:14:53,380
You have to do something.

215
00:14:53,380 --> 00:14:55,380
You are the police.

216
00:14:55,380 --> 00:14:59,380
That, waking up is not part of our actual duties.

217
00:15:00,380 --> 00:15:02,380
Don't explain it.

218
00:15:02,380 --> 00:15:06,380
You are our last, only hope, if only you would blow the whistle.

219
00:15:06,380 --> 00:15:08,380
No.

220
00:15:08,380 --> 00:15:10,380
It's a gizmo indoors.

221
00:15:10,380 --> 00:15:13,380
Just a pretense, then bang with a teddy bear gun.

222
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:17,380
Heaven forbid, I haven't.

223
00:15:24,380 --> 00:15:27,380
Hi, Muikkunen, sell.

224
00:15:28,380 --> 00:15:31,380
We still sleep soundly in the Moomin House.

225
00:15:36,380 --> 00:15:39,380
Well, snuff, Muikkunen, let's control it.

226
00:15:39,380 --> 00:15:41,380
Please change.

227
00:15:57,380 --> 00:15:59,380
Snuff, Muikkunen.

228
00:15:59,380 --> 00:16:01,380
Get angry, Konnipsu.

229
00:16:10,380 --> 00:16:12,380
Snuff, Muikkunen.

230
00:16:12,380 --> 00:16:15,380
Niskuneiti, wake up already, it's spring.

231
00:16:26,380 --> 00:16:28,380
Spring has come.

232
00:16:28,380 --> 00:16:30,380
Good morning, papa.

233
00:16:30,380 --> 00:16:32,380
Good morning, honey.

234
00:16:32,380 --> 00:16:34,380
Like I slept too much.

235
00:16:34,380 --> 00:16:36,380
Are the kids awake?

236
00:16:36,380 --> 00:16:38,380
About.

237
00:16:38,380 --> 00:16:40,380
The witch hunted you.

238
00:16:40,380 --> 00:16:42,380
Shut up, Nipsu.

239
00:16:42,380 --> 00:16:44,380
Do you trust witches?

240
00:16:44,380 --> 00:16:46,380
Snuff, Muikkunen.

241
00:16:50,380 --> 00:16:52,380
Good morning, gentlemen.

242
00:16:52,380 --> 00:16:54,380
Niskuneiti.

243
00:16:56,380 --> 00:16:59,380
I'm so glad you're back.

244
00:17:01,380 --> 00:17:03,380
Nipsuk is up early.

245
00:17:03,380 --> 00:17:05,380
Did you hear?

246
00:17:05,380 --> 00:17:07,380
The thing is, you got up late.

247
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:09,380
Me?

248
00:17:16,380 --> 00:17:17,380
Hello, hello.

249
00:17:17,380 --> 00:17:19,380
Moomin is awake.

250
00:17:20,380 --> 00:17:22,380
Hello, Nisku.

251
00:17:22,380 --> 00:17:24,380
Dear brother.

252
00:17:24,380 --> 00:17:26,380
He had to sleep forever.

253
00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:28,380
I was asleep when I last saw him.

254
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:30,380
That's true.

255
00:17:30,380 --> 00:17:32,380
Besides Moomin, mamma and papa.

256
00:17:33,380 --> 00:17:35,380
What kind of meeting is here?

257
00:17:35,380 --> 00:17:37,380
That's about it.

258
00:17:37,380 --> 00:17:39,380
Everyone is awake.

259
00:17:39,380 --> 00:17:41,380
I don't understand now.

260
00:17:41,380 --> 00:17:43,380
What don't you understand?

261
00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:45,380
We were worried when you didn't wake up at first.

262
00:17:45,380 --> 00:17:50,380
But Hemuli, you know that we hibernate.

263
00:17:50,380 --> 00:17:52,380
I know, I know, but when...

264
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:54,380
But Niska.

265
00:17:54,380 --> 00:17:57,380
Yeah, it was a bit of a problem to be honest.

266
00:17:57,380 --> 00:17:59,380
Snuff, Muikkunen.

267
00:17:59,380 --> 00:18:01,380
You're already back.

268
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:03,380
Yeah, can you hear me now, Moomin papa?

269
00:18:03,380 --> 00:18:05,380
No acceleration.

270
00:18:05,380 --> 00:18:11,380
Let's go inside for a cup of tea and talk about your problem.

271
00:18:11,380 --> 00:18:14,380
The problem is yours, not ours.

272
00:18:14,380 --> 00:18:18,380
Well, but we don't have any problems.

273
00:18:18,380 --> 00:18:20,380
Now everyone go inside the makom.

274
00:18:20,380 --> 00:18:23,380
Nuuska, Muikkunen and the children too.

275
00:18:23,380 --> 00:18:26,380
Better, please.

276
00:18:27,380 --> 00:18:29,380
Please let me know!

277
00:18:31,380 --> 00:18:34,380
Muikunen, what has happened to us?

278
00:18:39,380 --> 00:18:42,380
Alisa, Alisa!

279
00:18:46,380 --> 00:18:48,380
Oh, Moomin!

280
00:18:48,380 --> 00:18:50,380
We came to greet you.

281
00:18:50,380 --> 00:18:52,380
Oh, what fun!

282
00:18:52,380 --> 00:18:57,380
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

283
00:18:57,380 --> 00:18:59,380
To greet you.

284
00:18:59,380 --> 00:19:01,380
Oh, what fun!

285
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:03,380
No, isn't your grandma at home?

286
00:19:03,380 --> 00:19:05,380
No.

287
00:19:05,380 --> 00:19:07,380
Let's play hide and seek.

288
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:09,380
I promised grandma that I wouldn't...

289
00:19:09,380 --> 00:19:13,380
Yes, Nuuska, Muikkunen told about your promise.

290
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:18,380
You did great, but you just promised not to come to Moominvalley.

291
00:19:18,380 --> 00:19:20,380
So?

292
00:19:20,380 --> 00:19:24,380
But you didn't promise not to play with us.

293
00:19:24,380 --> 00:19:29,380
If we come here to play, you don't have to break your promise.

294
00:19:29,380 --> 00:19:31,380
Isn't that right?

295
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:34,380
That's right. It's absolutely true.

296
00:19:34,380 --> 00:19:36,380
The puzzle is solved.

297
00:19:38,380 --> 00:19:41,380
Eight, one...

298
00:19:54,380 --> 00:19:56,380
Hey, hey, hey!

299
00:19:56,380 --> 00:20:00,380
One, two, three...

300
00:20:00,380 --> 00:20:03,380
You mustn't spill the beans!

301
00:20:03,380 --> 00:20:10,380
Four, five, six, seven...

302
00:20:10,380 --> 00:20:13,380
Oh, that's good.

303
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:20,380
Nine, nine, nine, nine...

304
00:20:20,380 --> 00:20:22,380
That's good.
