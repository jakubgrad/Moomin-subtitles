1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
I can't believe my eyes.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
What has happened now?

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Well, look.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
The ant has a child on its foot.

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
It is a cut moth bush.

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Did it put the child on itself?

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
In no way.

8
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
But if it is, then it is a super intelligent ant.

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Hmm.

10
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Hmm.

11
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Dad, what's wrong?

12
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
There's a bowler hat in that bird's nest.

13
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:44,000
If it has been put there to keep the eggs warm while the mother birds are away.

14
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Yes.

15
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Emo has flown the top hat here.

16
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Yes, she is a sharp-headed mother bird.

17
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Ants and birds have suddenly become super-intelligent.

18
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
About ants?

19
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Hey daddy, come here.

20
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Short.

21
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Hey.

22
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Why are there bees here?

23
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Sweetheart.

24
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
When I went to get it, I found a broken honey can on the floor.

25
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Yes.

26
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Even bees have become super-intelligent.

27
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
What do you mean?

28
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Bees are logically much easier to get honey from the cellar,

29
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
like making it yourself from the nectar of the flowers.

30
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Bees can't handle heavy honey cans.

31
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Not one bee.

32
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:38,000
But if there are thousands or millions, or who knows how many.

33
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,000
You always want honey with your pancakes.

34
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
It's serious.

35
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Hey, let us have some honey.

36
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Be careful.

37
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
I'll take care of this.

38
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:02,000
All of a sudden, all in.

39
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Bees have become super-intelligent.

40
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Now this is a serious matter.

41
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
What is so serious?

42
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Birds and insects seem to have changed.

43
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:24,000
What if they have allied with each other and gradually start attacking us?

44
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,000
They have been able to decide that they want to live in a Moomin house.

45
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
It's really serious.

46
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Good heavens, I don't want bees in my bed.

47
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Now it's time to get down to business. Moomin comes to help.

48
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Clear.

49
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
We're safe now, Dad.

50
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Joo.

51
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,000
We can never ventilate the rooms again.

52
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
That's right.

53
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Birds can fly into the chimney.

54
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Who's there?

55
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
That's where Houska sits.

56
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Bun.

57
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Bun.

58
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Hmm.

59
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
The sun is too bright.

60
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
A bunch of parsley.

61
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Under the shade is better.

62
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Hello everyone.

63
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
I placed the parasol over the parsley.

64
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Now it's happy.

65
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Have you had anything to do with honey?

66
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Oh yes it is.

67
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
I make the bees so happy.

68
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Yes.

69
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
And did you take the top hat to the bird's nest?

70
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Even the birds want to be free from time to time.

71
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,000
And you apparently put a splint on an ant's foot.

72
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
So.

73
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,000
The anthill showed its severed leg.

74
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Hey.

75
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
It was a relief.

76
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Birds and insects have not changed.

77
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
So.

78
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
And they can't change either.

79
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
We can continue living here or what dad?

80
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,000
All items must be put back in their original order.

81
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Will you help mom?

82
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
No.

83
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Moomin Troll.

84
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
You scared me.

85
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
That Houska is a bit funny.

86
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Not you too?

87
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:22,000
On the contrary, I find him comfortable.

88
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,000
It doesn't seem funny to me.

89
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Look at her pretty nose.

90
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Where are you looking?

91
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Look at the nose.

92
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
He has such a characteristic nose.

93
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Beautiful nose line.

94
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
You rarely see a girl with such a beautiful nose.

95
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Oh right?

96
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
So.

97
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
I need to fix it for tomorrow.

98
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Let's go home already.

99
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Did you hear Nipsu?

100
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
I want to stay here.

101
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Stay then.

102
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Ooo.

103
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Hey.

104
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
What has happened to Nipsu?

105
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
He promised to come.

106
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
But it won't.

107
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
He has gone to meet that guy.

108
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Oh again?

109
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Absolutely.

110
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Has he abandoned us?

111
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
What was Nipsu really thinking?

112
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
If you know Nipsu, then hardly anything to mention.

113
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Oh dolphins.

114
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Hey.

115
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Muvibeikko is competing.

116
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
My dolphin is shy for us.

117
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Clear.

118
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
That's speed, Muvibeikko.

119
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Speed, speed, speed.

120
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
That's Nipsu now.

121
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
A pinch, hey.

122
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
What drives you?

123
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
You feel depressed.

124
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Nipsu, don't sit there and sigh.

125
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Then I want to look even more stupid than usual.

126
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
I have us.

127
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
You'll probably have a fever.

128
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
You look kind of sick.

129
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Do you have a cold?

130
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Oh poor.

131
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
You must go to bed.

132
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
How do you feel?

133
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Are there any pains?

134
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
On.

135
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
In the chest.

136
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
You look miserable.

137
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Ai, ai.

138
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
It can be.

139
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Just thank you.

140
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Just thank you.

141
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Fun.

142
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
What exactly did you say?

143
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
No.

144
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
I guess I didn't say anything.

145
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Yes, you said it.

146
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Fun.

147
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Did he really say that?

148
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Fun.

149
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Fun.

150
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Fun, Fun, Fun.

151
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Fun, Fun, Fun.

152
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
As soon as I think Funny,

153
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
the heart feels so bright

154
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
and in members from spring.

155
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
I have never experienced before

156
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
no similar feeling.

157
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Then it must be love.

158
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Wax.

159
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Nipsuko in love.

160
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
In that case, you can feed me to the hedgehog.

161
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Love.

162
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Is this what real love is like?

163
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
I don't like it.

164
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Moomin, tell me what to do.

165
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
You shouldn't ask your Moomin.

166
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
He has never been truly in love.

167
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Nobody.

168
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Am I not?

169
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Et.

170
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Well, if you have experienced that

171
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
tell Nipsu what to do.

172
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
to lower,

173
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Couldn't you tell?

174
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Well, maybe I can.

175
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Come here Nipsu.

176
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Try to tell Hauska

177
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
openly about your feelings.

178
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
It makes you feel better in every way.

179
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Do you have to reveal your feelings?

180
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
All right.

181
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
I'm going to tell you right away.

182
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Nipsu do your best.

183
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
What's wrong now?

184
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
What do I have to say?

185
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
For example.

186
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
I like you a lot.

187
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
i love you

188
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
i love you

189
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
i love you

190
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
i love you

191
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
I love you a lot.

192
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Yeah yeah

193
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
That's what I say.

194
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Yes, I can.

195
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Oh no, I can't.

196
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
My tongue goes into knots immediately.

197
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
When I see him.

198
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Nipsu has a serious disease.

199
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Moomin-Pekko,

200
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
maybe you should go with him.

201
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Huh? Me?

202
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Well, that's fine.

203
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,000
I'll stand behind you so I can whisper the words into your mouth.

204
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Good.

205
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Now is not the time to be shy.

206
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Tell him your case in a clear voice.

207
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
I started to go.

208
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Kas, hi Nipsu.

209
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
How can I help?

210
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Dude, what happened?

211
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Nipsu, hey listen, wait!

212
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Houska, listen Houska.

213
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,000
I love you, I really do.

214
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:07,000
It doesn't sound like it comes straight from the heart.

215
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Right?

216
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Pants dear!

217
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,000
I love you, I really do.

218
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Houska, Houska dear!

219
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Bun, Bun, Bun!

220
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
I won't let you go, no, no!

221
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Bun, Bun, Bun!

222
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Pinch, Pinch, stop already.

223
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,000
I think that's powerful enough.

224
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Is it?

225
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
I gained your confidence myself.

226
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
I'll do it, I'll do it!

227
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Come on, Nipsu, it's fine.

228
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
I'm ready.

229
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Are you there?

230
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
I love you!

231
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:06,000
You scared me and the flower arrangement, didn't I...

232
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
I love you!

233
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
I love you!

234
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
I love you!

235
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
I love you!

236
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,000
and the flower arrangement sank into the air.

237
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Now I know. I help Ouska collect flowers.

238
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
I will collect flowers for you.

239
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Tel!

240
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Ouska! I collected flowers for you.

241
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
What have you done, Barbarians?

242
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
I help collect flowers.

243
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:56,000
I pluck away the rich food so that the flowers can grow freely.

244
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Little flower holes, a purse robber, a spoiled brat and the unlucky ones.

245
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
You can grow up yourself.

246
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
The murder of that and...

247
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:12,000
And don't ever appear before my eyes again.

248
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
It must have hurt you.

249
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
A pinch!

250
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
A pinch!

251
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
It must have gone bad.

252
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:52,000
I don't think you are meant to be a first lover.

253
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Don't cry!

254
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Ah!

255
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Ouska muikkunen, don't play such a sad tone.

256
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Nipsu got the gloves and needs something to cheer him up.

257
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Oh, sorry.

258
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Niu is you, what we do to Nipsu.

259
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
I don't understand.

260
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:26,000
That usual shock has never hit me.

261
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:55,000
I don't want the shock to happen to me either.

262
00:15:55,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Besides, it's not the usual one, but an individual mine.

263
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:08,000
I don't want to grow up.

264
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
A pinch!

265
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Nipsu just has to try to forget Ouska.

266
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:21,000
Nipsu just has to try to forget Ouska.

267
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:24,000
I don't know of any other cure.

268
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
A pinch!

269
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
A pinch!

270
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
where are you from

271
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
A pinch!

272
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,000
A pinch!

273
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Where has Nipsu disappeared to?

274
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Oh honey, why do you have a frying pan with you?

275
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
A frying pan?

276
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,000
I give Nipsu all ears.

277
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:56,000
It is the best way in the world to teach to forget.

278
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Oh yeah.

279
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,000
A pinch!

280
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000
A pinch!

281
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
A pinch!

282
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,000
A pinch!

283
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Isn't that Nipsu?

284
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:38,000
What exactly is going through his mind?

285
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Oh, the horror!

286
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:43,000
I never thought he would be this desperate.

287
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
What?

288
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,000
Of course not.

289
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
We must thwart his intentions.

290
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,000
A pinch!

291
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,000
Don't be a hata, Ousu!

292
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:58,000
You know a lot yourself!

293
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:02,000
You deserve to go in the water!

294
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,000
A pinch!

295
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,000
Oh, oh, oh! Grab my paw!

296
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
Moomin, what did that mean?

297
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
What did you try?

298
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:20,000
We thought you were going to go into the water.

299
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
We would like to be saved.

300
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
What did that mean?

301
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,000
It meant you were going to go in the water.

302
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
It meant you were going to go in the water.

303
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
It meant you were going to go in the water.

304
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
We would like to save you.

305
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
I would go in the water?

306
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
Are you shaken?

307
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
I can't even swim.

308
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,000
So why were you on the platform?

309
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:46,000
I came to wash my face with cold water,

310
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:50,000
that I would forget the heartaches caused by fun.

311
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,000
What?

312
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
You weren't going to drown, were you?

313
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:56,000
Of course not. It's stupid.

314
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,000
I don't waste money in a frying pan.

315
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Thus!

316
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
Ai, ai, ai!

317
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,000
A frying pan helps better than cold water.

318
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
Aaaah!

319
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:15,000
You noticed that I was able to escape.

320
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:21,000
Blows help you forget.

321
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Aaaah!

322
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:29,000
You won't think twice before falling in love the first time.

323
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
Head!

324
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,000
And that's what you get! And about that!

325
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
Don't miss out!

326
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
Oh!

327
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:07,000
A pinch! A pinch! Did that occur to you?

328
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
Nipsure sock.

329
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
Yeah, it came.

330
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:18,000
I just remembered that I haven't eaten a single crumb since yesterday.

331
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
What discipline! What discipline!

332
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:26,000
Well, you finally got things in the right order of importance.

333
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
A pinch of health!

334
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:47,000
Here comes more pancakes.

335
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:50,000
Thank you very much. I like it.

336
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:54,000
Long order, Rahmi!

337
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:03,000
Hauska probably wouldn't have been able to bake as good pancakes as her mother.

338
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
Thank you!
