1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Moomin Valley seems to have returned to its former peaceful state.

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
There is no sign of worry anywhere.

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Or for a while anyway.

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Moomin wait!

5
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Mother, mother! Are they ready?

6
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,000
What?

7
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Pancakes!

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Not yet, the magician's trees burn carefully.

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
You're just making the dough.

10
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Pancakes don't take long to fry.

11
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Are the pancakes ready?

12
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
This concern is overwhelming.

13
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I'm such a muggle head, you fool!

14
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
And you're not stupid, you're wise.

15
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Phew! I'm an unhappy tuner, rotten egg.

16
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
A wanderer, you would scurry decently on the ground.

17
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Pah!

18
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
If you know how to make a sledgehammer that moves on the ground,

19
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
you can certainly build one that flies in the air.

20
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I believe in talent.

21
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
I don't think there's much to anything about tohelo.

22
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Last night I thought, now me.

23
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,000
I have finally managed to make a flying rake.

24
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
But then I looked again at my work, how I,

25
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:27,000
who am so sensible, I can be so low-witted.

26
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I'm a complete moron.

27
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Pancakes are ready. Go tell everyone.

28
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
I can go too.

29
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Where are Moomin and Snow Maiden?

30
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Niiskunneiti has been again.

31
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Ai.

32
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Don't take it so hard.

33
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Biscuits fall into depression when their inventions fail.

34
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Also Moomin Pappako.

35
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Don't make up stories, will you?

36
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Yeah, or memoirs.

37
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Niiskunnetti, Would you like the pancake?

38
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Yes, please enjoy.

39
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Moomin go get daddy.

40
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
He's stuck on his writing stick again.

41
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Joo.

42
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Niiskunkunnie, what is this?

43
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:17,000
As morning came, the sun circled the eastern sky and gradually.

44
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Everything began to cherish.

45
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Even the smallest fool reads.

46
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Oh, I have absolutely no literary talent.

47
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,000
I'm a miserable hobbyist with no writing skills.

48
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Best to stop.

49
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
In.

50
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
What is it?

51
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Mom told me to eat pancakes.

52
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Oh, I'm struggling in the throes of creation, I'll be back later.

53
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Aha.

54
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Was there anything else?

55
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
It was, no.

56
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
I guess I heard wrong.

57
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I heard wrong too.

58
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Moomin, I'm waiting, I'll come.

59
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Yes, it tasted good.

60
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
I'm going out.

61
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
I'm not going either.

62
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:20,000
No, I'm going on a dangerous research trip with the snuska-muikku.

63
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Hi, snuffbox.

64
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Hello to yourself, I thought you would come.

65
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
What is that?

66
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:43,000
A leaf boat, it sails all the way down the river.

67
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:50,000
It goes all the way to the sea and drifts to some unknown land.

68
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Sometimes I take a boat trip somewhere.

69
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Shall we go?

70
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:59,000
The little girl wanted to come along, but I said it was too dangerous.

71
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
You should have chosen your words better.

72
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Look.

73
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Hey, wait!

74
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
They too needed excitement in their lives.

75
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Wait!

76
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Are we really going to climb a mountain?

77
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,000
I don't think all of us can do it.

78
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
I'm not going up.

79
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
But I will go.

80
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
I prefer to keep me company.

81
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Uh, can't you girls wait for us in the cave?

82
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,000
It's right next to the path.

83
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Do you see that you can walk along the path?

84
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
It is difficult for the girl to understand this matter.

85
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
It's really hard to understand.

86
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
We want to climb.

87
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Let's go already.

88
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Will you come along, Jysu?

89
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:55,000
I guarded the background. I protect the cave from below.

90
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Pelkuri.

91
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Don't underestimate. Someone has to stay behind to watch the girls.

92
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Shall we go to the cave?

93
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
I don't care.

94
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Better stay here. You never know who lives in the cave.

95
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
That too, Fool. Nobody lives there.

96
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
That's why I don't care.

97
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,000
An uninhabited place is creepy.

98
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,000
I think we are right above the cave now.

99
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
I can't see the opening leading down.

100
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Maybe it's a little towards that.

101
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Wow, I've never seen a clam like this.

102
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
And what about that?

103
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Mussels like that are probably valuable.

104
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Little Myy, come here!

105
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Where is Little Myy?

106
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
He pressed into the cave.

107
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Terrible, he should come and collect seashells.

108
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Sell, get out of there!

109
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
To the ground, Rabbit!

110
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000
It's dangerous to go in without a fog!

111
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Well, how the hell would you go in then?

112
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Wait there! We will save you!

113
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:31,000
I guess you, Niiskun, and you won't come with me to the cave anyway?

114
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Yes, I create.

115
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Well, let's go then.

116
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,000
I'll take your hand in case you get scared.

117
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
where are you

118
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,000
You'll make Niiskuneidin afraid!

119
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Oh, I thought I'd scare you!

120
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Your voice is shaking!

121
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,000
My voice always sounds like this!

122
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Shhh! Helja!

123
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
I hear something!

124
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
I can hear it too. Maybe the wind.

125
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
It didn't hear!

126
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
I can hear it too.

127
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
I can hear it too.

128
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
I can hear it too. Maybe the wind.

129
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:15,000
It doesn't sound like a jerk!

130
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:20,000
You can't scare me! Nobody lives here!

131
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Moomin and Snoopy are just there.

132
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,000
They have come down to the cave and now they...

133
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Why would Moomin and Snuska Muikkunen snore?

134
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Yes, it must be someone else...

135
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Oh sell! Let's stop!

136
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
I'm pulling a Moomin now!

137
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Is it good now?

138
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Which goes first?

139
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
I!

140
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
But remember to be careful!

141
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Clear!

142
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Who goes first!

143
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Quietly. There's no rush.

144
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Are you OK?

145
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Of course.

146
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Ai myy!

147
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Help!

148
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Moomin are you okay?

149
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Moomin Hoo!

150
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
I believe so.

151
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Except for the back panel.

152
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Who shouted so cruelly?

153
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Our friend Hemuli was here for a nap.

154
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Oh heaven.

155
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,000
This is one of your games again.

156
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:14,000
We didn't know you had settled in comfortably here on Nokos.

157
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:18,000
I had not settled comfortably at Nokos at all.

158
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
So what are you doing here?

159
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:25,000
To tell you the truth. I haven't been myself lately.

160
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Have you lost a rare stamp again?

161
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Vice versa. I have them all.

162
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:36,000
An Aiki stamp, which a collector can have.

163
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,000
So what else is there?

164
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,000
My stamp collection is complete.

165
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:47,000
And no one has a better stamp collection than you.

166
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Of course not. Mine is the best.

167
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:55,000
There isn't a single rarity or misprint that I don't have.

168
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Then I don't understand.

169
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,000
I am young. And besides, there are no collectors.

170
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Ai, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you

171
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,000
No, if we're being precise

172
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Hemuli was in the cave taking a nap

173
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Oh, Hemuli parka

174
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Cah, the ghost's sobs were his snoring

175
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,000
I never snore

176
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,000
You're snoring

177
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,000
I'm here

178
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Kattia kans

179
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:59,000
If you don't tell anyone, I'll show you something special

180
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
What is it?

181
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Oh boy!

182
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
That's it

183
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Ampa wonderful

184
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Beautiful Russian

185
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Someone owns it

186
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
I guess that could be fixed

187
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Of course, and it wouldn't even be difficult

188
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,000
You don't know that, the bottom looks bad

189
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
I'm sure it's seaworthy

190
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
There are holes in the kurje

191
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Oars are missing

192
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
You don't need them, we paddle with our hands

193
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
You melotte

194
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Be careful, the boat is rocking ha

195
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Russian

196
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:00,000
I've lost my confidence and it makes me feel weird

197
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
That happens to anyone

198
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
For you too

199
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Yes, but not very often

200
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Well, that's a relief

201
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,000
How do I get my confidence back?

202
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
I don't know

203
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Mine usually comes back in its own time

204
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,000
I hardly ever make another plan

205
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,000
I, too, can leave my memoirs to be torn apart

206
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
What's wrong with you all?

207
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
You look so gloomy

208
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,000
I was too confident

209
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
So do I

210
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Hi, Moominpapa, Moominpapa

211
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:51,000
What's wrong, Nipsu? We can hear even if we don't howl

212
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Come to the shore quickly, we have found the boat

213
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Oh, the wreck that washed ashore?

214
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,000
It's not a wreck, it has a sail

215
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,000
We fix the boat and then it's ours

216
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
I will come

217
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:12,000
I'm coming, Nipsu. Adventure is exactly what you need to cheer yourself up

218
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
As old

219
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:17,000
You might be interested if the boat has a sail

220
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Yes, yes. A neat little ship

221
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Good shape

222
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Father, is it ours because it has been abandoned?

223
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Maybe the boat has been left here on its own luck

224
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Because it leaks

225
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
That would be understandable

226
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:42,000
But discoverers always become owners

227
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
It's not quite like that

228
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
I have to wait a bit first

229
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
So what do we do, Father?

230
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:55,000
We need to refit the boat so that we can anchor it in case of a storm

231
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Necessarily

232
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:02,000
My guess is that if the owner comes forward, we wouldn't give up the boat

233
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:06,000
On the other hand, no one may know where the boat is

234
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,000
So what do we do after we've restored it?

235
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Pity the boats left on the beach

236
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Sending a sail to the seven seas?

237
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
No, no, no, no

238
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:19,000
I think I'll see the rest of the world too

239
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
I think I'll watch together

240
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
I think I'll see the rest of the world too

241
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:26,000
I guess I'll look around

242
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
And you don't have to fear

243
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,000
If we got into big waves, we sailed between them

244
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
And not so, Moomin papa?

245
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Roughly

246
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Well, my friend, let's get it done

247
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Will you help with the planning, Nisku?

248
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
That's fine

249
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Moomin papa, can I do something?

250
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Would you really?

251
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Well, if you don't mind

252
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,000
I'm not really a construction guy

253
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,000
First we have to pull the boat dry

254
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Russian!

255
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:02,000
We need at least ten miner sleepers under the boat

256
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
I'm going by myself

257
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Me too

258
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
And me!

259
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:11,000
And then you probably need a few more logs for the floor

260
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
And we need a lot of nails

261
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:17,000
That's right, we also need a ladle and a full head

262
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:20,000
I'll help choose the nails

263
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:24,000
And I'll guard the boat if the owner comes to pick it up

264
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Ram the sails

265
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
What?

266
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
Are the children sleeping?

267
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
They sleep like logs

268
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:18,000
No wonder they worked so hard

269
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:22,000
I can't wait for us to sail somewhere

270
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Yeah, I'll take you anywhere in the world you want

271
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Anywhere

272
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
I don't miss far

273
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Shall we go to sleep? We have to get up early

274
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Oh, Meri, life is a hard seat for a worker

275
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:45,000
Yes, I just feel so bad about this

276
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,000
Ressu, Meri is good for him

277
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Hi, hi

278
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Perfectly patched, even if I do say so myself

279
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
And now the rest

280
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
Joo

281
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,000
Look, Moomin, I'll tar the boat

282
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Yeah, yeah, I only tar where you can't reach

283
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Nipsu, hepse, macra crab, you can get more tar

284
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Ha, ha, myself! I let you tar because you wanted to

285
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Picking up tar is not my thing

286
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Start speeding up, get off your bums

287
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Shall I cut from this, cut it off mom?

288
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
Cut, that's it

289
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
What's wrong, Hemuli?

290
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:58,000
The boat work seems to be progressing hastily

291
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,000
True, it will be ready soon

292
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
That's what I was afraid of

293
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,000
So what did I come up with?

294
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,000
Couldn't you come up with a new collectible?

295
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
Like what?

296
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,000
Anything, like collecting butterflies

297
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
It won't even be heard

298
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
Well, decorative items

299
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
Decorative items

300
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
He can collect them endlessly

301
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Unscientific

302
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:28,000
I think you should start collecting something

303
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
Mother, mother

304
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,000
Hurry up, we're driving, we're getting on board

305
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
Mother, mother

306
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
Mother, mother

307
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
We ride we get on board

308
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
I'm coming, I'm coming

309
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:56,000
You conjured the sail really nicely, come on

310
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
Are you ready?

311
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
Push with all your might

312
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
Y...

313
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
K...

314
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
A...

315
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
And now for the test sailing

316
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
Joo

317
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,000
Great hemuli

318
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
Come on, mom

319
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
I think I'm going home

320
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:58,000
I just got a new idea for a flywheel

321
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
Now I can get it working

322
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
It's as clear as day

323
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
Let's go later

324
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,000
You untie the rope, start paddling

325
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:10,000
Mamma, we'll be back for dinner

326
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
You don't have to

327
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,000
I only make cold cuts

328
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:18,000
Ups, ups, ups
