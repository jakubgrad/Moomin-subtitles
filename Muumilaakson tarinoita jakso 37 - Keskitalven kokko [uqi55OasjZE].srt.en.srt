1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,960
From the Mona attackers

2
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:22,000
During his long winter Moomin had a dream.

3
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Oddly enough, he dreamed that he was sleeping.

4
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Moomin! Moomin!

5
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Alisa!

6
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Alisa, you have learned to fly on a broomstick!

7
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Yep, I'm a fully flying witch now!

8
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Hey, take me for a ride!

9
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
No way!

10
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Don't be boring!

11
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
I already have a passenger!

12
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
I!

13
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Myy!

14
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Alisa, can't we go higher?

15
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Joo!

16
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Come back! I want to fly too!

17
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Can I fly now?

18
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Hop in!

19
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Hey!

20
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Just like a dream.

21
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Still true.

22
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Ugh! Alice! No, no bouncing!

23
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
What are you talking about? The road is flat!

24
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Sell, is that you? No wonder the broom shakes.

25
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
I'm pretty clever, aren't I?

26
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Hey, where did you get the broom?

27
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Well, I borrowed the witches.

28
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Did you borrow?

29
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Well, I borrowed the witches!

30
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Did you borrow?

31
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
And don't ask for permission now!

32
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
No, there's a witch over there.

33
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
So it seems.

34
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
We better fade away.

35
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
True.

36
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Stand two. Give me back my bone.

37
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
No luck!

38
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Yeah, I did.

39
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
You have another broom. What can you fly with?

40
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
This is just a parabone.

41
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
This is my real bone.

42
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
This broom is now mine!

43
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Or a broom? Phew! It's not a bone.

44
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Take a closer look.

45
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Isn't this a bone?

46
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Snake!

47
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Myy!

48
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Moomin!

49
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Sell, are you safe?

50
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Myy is not here.

51
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Right?

52
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
I dreamed.

53
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
You scream out loud.

54
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Oh, sorry. Did I wake you up?

55
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Can you see anything?

56
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Just snow.

57
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
It's so bright.

58
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
To kill you.

59
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Creepy light.

60
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
It is.

61
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Spring hasn't come yet.

62
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
No.

63
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Then everyone sleeps.

64
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
At least most of them.

65
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Is my brother still watching?

66
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Of course.

67
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:50,000
He said he would have the blue copies ready by spring.

68
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
But is it possible to succeed?

69
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Shall we go see?

70
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Let's jump out and get in the middle.

71
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Well, not anyway.

72
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
It's warm and wonderful at Peitana.

73
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Oh, let's sleep until spring like all decent people.

74
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Spring is still far away.

75
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Oh yeah

76
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Well, let's sleep then.

77
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Niiskunnuni, Did you say something?

78
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Oh, I'm really hungry.

79
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Moominmamma, vaapukka juice tastes good.

80
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
So.

81
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Everyone praised it last winter.

82
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Moomin troll.

83
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
What?

84
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,000
I have a feeling that someone is watching us.

85
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Are there people here besides Moominpa and Moominamma?

86
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Of course it is.

87
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
What?

88
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Cry?

89
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Where?

90
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Tuutikki lives in the bathroom and does not hibernate.

91
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:16,000
I heard from him last winter that there are many little creatures that are too shy to show themselves.

92
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Are there any here?

93
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,000
I guess, even though we can't see them.

94
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Behind the counter, for example, and in the clock, in the oven, and in the dark corners of the room, I sensed it.

95
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Have you messed with the oven?

96
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,000
I don't. They would have been nervous. You shouldn't even know.

97
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
What do they look like?

98
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Tuutikki said that some of them look a bit like us, like our ancestors.

99
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Like us?

100
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Well, I haven't seen them.

101
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Are they as pretty as us?

102
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,000
I Tainan will watch and wait for the dawn.

103
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
I do the same.

104
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Moomin Peiki

105
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Now you have to be as quiet as a mouse so that Moomin's ancestor doesn't get scared.

106
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Has it dawned yet? Are you ready?

107
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Well I am.

108
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,000
The sky is cloudy, but the owl is hidden.

109
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Maybe it doesn't come up at all this time of year.

110
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Moomin, I miss this.

111
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,000
What do you need a broom for?

112
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,000
I'll borrow it, I won't stay long.

113
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:42,000
What are you whining about? You already know how to fly with a broom, don't you?

114
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,000
I'm leaving now, you can't do anything.

115
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Put the broom here and be tidy.

116
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:51,000
How many times do I have to say you can't go to Moomin Valley?

117
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:55,000
It's boring here, I want company.

118
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Fly broom, fly.

119
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
I'm taking me to Moomin Valley.

120
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Hop, hop, hop.

121
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Fly obey me fly now.

122
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Hard-eared girl.

123
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,000
I'm flying.

124
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Oh, brothers, how wonderful.

125
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Must not.

126
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:36,000
What do you say now? Are you still complaining that it's boring?

127
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,000
And for a change like this.

128
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
How do you feel?

129
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,000
No, Grandma, stop the broom.

130
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Come on, you wanted to fly on a broom.

131
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,000
First solo flight.

132
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Grandma, please, don't stop the broom.

133
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:05,000
If you want to learn how to fly a broom,

134
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:09,000
forget about ketaled and focus on studying.

135
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:13,000
It's hard work you know.

136
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,000
What, are you mocking me too?

137
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,000
I can climb down.

138
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:31,000
You can stand, and even if you fall, there is soft snow below.

139
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Don't move your ladder, grandma, I'm scaring you.

140
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:39,000
So, to the elevators, and don't blink down.

141
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Was it worth going out now?

142
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Now we could not have continued our sleep.

143
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
It went great.

144
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
It went great.

145
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Snow is like cold fine sugar.

146
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,000
So I'm standing on top of the stairwell?

147
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,000
You stand, everything is under the snow.

148
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Why is the liter door open?

149
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
What now?

150
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
The trees have dwindled.

151
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Someone else is burning our trees.

152
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
But who and why?

153
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,000
I sensed that we were not alone in the forest.

154
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
There are winter animals here.

155
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
It's something else.

156
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Bogey!

157
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,000
It grows huge in winter.

158
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Granny, I'm scared.

159
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Don't worry.

160
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Goofy, stop it.

161
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Don't come any closer.

162
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,000
You're too cool for us.

163
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,000
You can chill us to icicles.

164
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Oh my goodness, you don't feel lonely at all.

165
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,000
I don't think we can help you.

166
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,000
At least without fur and earflaps.

167
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Come on, little lady.

168
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Who has brought this big firewood, look?

169
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
It knows something bad.

170
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,000
There has been more than one.

171
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Hoop!

172
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Pure whiteness for the naked eye.

173
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Peeking into the bathroom?

174
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Tuttik!

175
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Tuttik!

176
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
There's nobody here.

177
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Right?

178
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Ah, see for yourself.

179
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Shouldn't there be some invisible heads here?

180
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:20,000
It's hard to know about things you can't see.

181
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
What is it?

182
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Like something was holding my back.

183
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,000
So, of course. It's one of the heads.

184
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Mummy, peikk, yes!

185
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Where has it gone?

186
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Hi, unusual. I've never seen anything like it.

187
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Bye bye, Moomin, Goblin.

188
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Did you guess where Tuutikki is?

189
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Hello, Tuttiki!

190
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Hello, Tuutikki!

191
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,000
This winter, Niiskunneitiki is behind.

192
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
I woke him up by accident.

193
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,000
You know that spring is still far away.

194
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Yeh, the sun doesn't even want to rise.

195
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,000
But tomorrow the sun will come back.

196
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Will you come?

197
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Niiskuneitti was worried when the sun remained hidden.

198
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:15,000
However, the sun sets almost immediately.

199
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Tuutikki, Moomin there must have been bandits in the valley.

200
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Don't now.

201
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:24,000
A large pile of firewood has appeared on the rock.

202
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Share, that's right. I do know.

203
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Among them are our trees.

204
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Yes, unfortunately nothing can be done about it.

205
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:37,000
The critters of winter are pretty indifferent when it comes to ownership.

206
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:41,000
They need a lot of fuel for the midwinter bonfire.

207
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Midwinter bonfire?

208
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Now your trees can also participate in this celebration.

209
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Bonfires are lit to attract the sun back.

210
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Well, isn't the sun coming back anyway?

211
00:12:55,000 --> 00:13:00,000
You don't know that. The bonfire is always lit on the same day.

212
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
At night you will see winter animals.

213
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,000
If you live in the bathroom, would you let?

214
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:09,000
If you sit still and I don't scare them away.

215
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Good, you come along.

216
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Well, of course I will.

217
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Wait, you can't.

218
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Did someone scream?

219
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Who is that?

220
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Don't come any closer, I didn't do it on purpose.

221
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Get us out or grandma will turn you into a toad.

222
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:28,000
I already apologized to you, don't stay angry for too long.

223
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:32,000
I'm cold, please go away.

224
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Stupid, stop, you can't.

225
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Dude, leave Alisa alone.

226
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Grandma, troll.

227
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Alisa.

228
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Goofy, Alisa is my friend, be nice to her.

229
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,000
It just stood there drooling while I skied down the hill.

230
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,000
I managed to dodge so that I didn't even touch it.

231
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
It's okay, Alisa.

232
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Listen now, Mörkö.

233
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Isn't Alisa a pretty girl?

234
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Well, Morkö.

235
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:11,000
I must have used a slur, but I apologized nicely.

236
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
What's wrong with that?

237
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Then I asked if it had seen you and it got the hepuli.

238
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
It's mysterious.

239
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Dude, what the hell is wrong with you?

240
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
A grunt.

241
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Oh yes, I freaked out.

242
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
It's nice that you came to visit.

243
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,000
I had a hunch somehow that the old man was still awake.

244
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
And so I came.

245
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Well, what did your grandma say?

246
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Nothing, because I didn't say I was coming here.

247
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Granny Goblin was brave when she chased away the bully.

248
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
The bully usually doesn't attack anyone.

249
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Maybe Mörkö doesn't like Alisa.

250
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Just like Eiti.

251
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,000
What did Mörö have to do with being here anyway?

252
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Mörkö wanted to see granny troll.

253
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
And why?

254
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Because it's in love with granny troll.

255
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
May I be protected.

256
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Hey, what now?

257
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,000
If Mörkö is really in love with grandma.

258
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Don't bother.

259
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
This is going too far.

260
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,000
I just that it's not like that.

261
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
It's true.

262
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,000
What's that drumming?

263
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,000
The invisible heads are calling.

264
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
When will the animals come?

265
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,000
They are already here, all around us.

266
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Oh, are they? Where, where?

267
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Oh yeah, you can't see them.

268
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:13,000
I don't see any critters either, but I feel they are here.

269
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Oh, are they? Where, where?

270
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Oh yeah, you can't see them.

271
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:23,000
I don't see any critters either, but I feel they are here.

272
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Yeah, but you Alisa are a witch.

273
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Yes, you and the goblin will soon find out.

274
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Wake up!

275
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Wake up!

276
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:18,000
Oops! Now I see one of them over there.

277
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Wake up!

278
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Now I see too. Are there a lot of them?

279
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Did you find out where the little heads stay?

280
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:42,000
You never see them.

281
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:46,000
So how do you know that they are the ones that are making the drums?

282
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Kasku, they sometimes get dirty in the bathroom too.

283
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:52,000
How great, Juhla?

284
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,000
I would have missed this.

285
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,000
What happened now?

286
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Bogey.

287
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:20,000
What is Mörkö doing here?

288
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,000
It has come to see Granny again.

289
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:26,000
No, it wants to warm itself in the blaze of flames.

290
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,000
Hi hey!

291
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,000
Mörkö ruined the party.

292
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:54,000
Oh my, our Mörkö parka.

293
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:59,000
No matter where it lands its icy backside, there remains a stupid smudge.

294
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Well, Mörkö, saved our firewood a bit.

295
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,000
Oh!

296
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:17,000
Oh!

297
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:20,000
Oh!

298
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,000
So I didn't use your hands.

299
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:26,000
I really want to sleep.

300
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:31,000
I thought I'd stay awake until the next sunrise, but I guess I can't stay awake until then.

301
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:34,000
See you again next spring.

302
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:39,000
Bye bye, and take care.

303
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:43,000
Yay yay, the moon lights up my journey home.

304
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:04,000
The blocking of Kuuvie and Alisa must be stopped.

305
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,000
I have to take real action.

306
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:12,000
Let's get real!

307
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:17,000
What did the witch mean?

308
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:20,000
It sounded very threatening.

309
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:25,000
Let's hope that the witch will let the Moomins sleep until spring.
