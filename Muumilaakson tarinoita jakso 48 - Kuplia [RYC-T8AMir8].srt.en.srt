1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
The moon shone over Moomin Valley.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
There will be moonlight.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
The moon looks big.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Yes, but it gets smaller as you go up.

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
It just looks smaller.

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
You never know about the moon.

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
What now? The witch is flying again.

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
A witch? Where?

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
There, at the edge of the moon.

10
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Oh, now I see him.

11
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
I feel sorry for Niisku.

12
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Yes, sometimes you get your aircraft ready.

13
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Yeah, but he's wasting an awful lot of time.

14
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Niiskuneiti said that Niisku has apparently designed a new ship.

15
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Didn't give a damn.

16
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Oh, why not dad?

17
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Well, when Niiskua wakes up so heartily with his ship.

18
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
But look at those.

19
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
He jumps clear of the old broom, grabs something and sweeps his way.

20
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Just like that, unfair.

21
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Niisku, I'm going to sleep now.

22
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Aha.

23
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Doesn't keep watch every night.

24
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Succeeded!

25
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
What worked?

26
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Fortifying agent.

27
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
It does a lot.

28
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Succeeded!

29
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Succeeded!

30
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Succeeded!

31
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Succeeded!

32
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Succeeded!

33
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Succeeded!

34
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Fortifying agent.

35
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
It makes paper and cloth indestructible.

36
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Have you figured it out for your aviation?

37
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Of course.

38
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
You will be the first to hear about my invention.

39
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Don't tell anyone.

40
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
And, and.

41
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Hi Is this your new ship?

42
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
So.

43
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Now it doesn't look like a ship anymore.

44
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Well, no.

45
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:55,000
The previous flying machine was far too heavy and consumed too much fuel.

46
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
But this new version is very light.

47
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Made of fabric and not wood.

48
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000
And I dip the fabric in my cookie solution so that it becomes strong.

49
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Yes, Isko, you are a remarkable scientist.

50
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
There is a puzzle.

51
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Nope.

52
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
My new ship floats beautifully.

53
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Of course I planned it.

54
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:19,000
But I don't know how to make it go where I want.

55
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
What are you researching?

56
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Water.

57
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
What about water?

58
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
The dome.

59
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Kuplin?

60
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Well, a bubble.

61
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Bubbles pop to the surface.

62
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
It was really big recently.

63
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Well, five bubbles.

64
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
But who makes them?

65
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Something is rotting at the bottom.

66
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
I think so.

67
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
I thought that if someone has special bubbles.

68
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Something is rotting at the bottom.

69
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Mother.

70
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
So?

71
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Can you give me some soap?

72
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
What do you need it for?

73
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Roll soap bubbles.

74
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
All the nicest.

75
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,000
I don't know how much soap to add to the water.

76
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Now.

77
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
I have to wait for the soap to dissolve.

78
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Well then.

79
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
The dome.

80
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
The dome.

81
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
The dome.

82
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
The dome.

83
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
The dome.

84
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
The dome.

85
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
The dome.

86
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
I have to wait for the soap to dissolve.

87
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
I think bigger bubbles.

88
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
But there will be more small ones.

89
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Moomin veikko, we guarantee big ones.

90
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Don't blow so hard.

91
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
The soap is out of date.

92
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Should it flow more?

93
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Oh, wonderful.

94
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Could I blow too?

95
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Of course.

96
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Yes?

97
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Weird.

98
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Is this just soap and water?

99
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Is there anything else needed?

100
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Oh yes.

101
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Otherwise, bubble.

102
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
The dome.

103
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
The dome.

104
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
The dome.

105
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
The dome.

106
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Shall we then go to the left-hand view?

107
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Do you know?

108
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
I'm clear!

109
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
It was achieved.

110
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Take our own cup, to our people.

111
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:17,000
I've started giving and seeing each other.

112
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Let's go!

113
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Jouni fainted,î.

114
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Al it is!

115
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
No more cutting!

116
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
House spщё!

117
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Jone's sexual drink!

118
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Oh!

119
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Stay!

120
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Oh!

121
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Huot platforms!

122
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
You talk!

123
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
You talk!

124
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
You talk!

125
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Let's try.

126
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
We'll see how it goes.

127
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Just like Hemuli said.

128
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Give me my side.

129
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Wonderful.

130
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Yeah, but I want even bigger ones.

131
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Oh yeah.

132
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
What now?

133
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,000
I think I know how to get huge bubbles.

134
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:11,000
My sister told me that the witch has been flying her broom around here again.

135
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
On, on.

136
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Do you, Pakerrat, still have your aircraft?

137
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Of course.

138
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
I fly on a scientific basis.

139
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:22,000
I wouldn't mind knowing how to fly on an old broom stick.

140
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Well, of course.

141
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Moomin papa, anyone can fly with a broom.

142
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,000
And it's so terribly unscientific.

143
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
That's how it is.

144
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,000
But even those have to practice flying.

145
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Is there something wrong with the broom?

146
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:43,000
No, but I wish it had something like an armchair as a seat.

147
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Get wet.

148
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:51,000
You continue your work and show the witch that you can fly without spells.

149
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
That's what I'll do, Moomin papa.

150
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Pane, we hope for you, Miss Niisku.

151
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,000
It's probably a bit of dampness.

152
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
We don't need much.

153
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Miss Niisku, Do you believe that Niisku's aircraft will ever fly?

154
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Of course. Niisku's triggers always work.

155
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Niisku, may I come?

156
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Niisku should lock the door.

157
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Anyone can come in and grab his miracle liquid.

158
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,000
He's an invention and not a shopkeeper.

159
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Here it is.

160
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Is there?

161
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
On.

162
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Doesn't look like much. Could it have any effect?

163
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
I'll show you.

164
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
We'd rather wait for Niisku to come.

165
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Don't get angry.

166
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
We only take a few drops.

167
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
But...

168
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
I'll tell Niisku when he comes.

169
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
It's timely enough.

170
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,000
I can't wait to blow big bubbles.

171
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
This is a scientific experiment.

172
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Niisku is only satisfied when he finds out if his substance also works for soap bubbles.

173
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Now I'm fiddling.

174
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
As long as you don't overdo it.

175
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Orhita a lot.

176
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Maybe too much.

177
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Better too much than too little.

178
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Be careful, Myy.

179
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Stay away. It could explode.

180
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Oh boys, how big.

181
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,000
No, Niisku's invention is a fascinating sport.

182
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
The bubble gets bigger and bigger.

183
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
The bubble looks really tough.

184
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Now it left.

185
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
No good.

186
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
And it still hasn't crashed.

187
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Let's go outside and blow even bigger bubbles.

188
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Pretty funny.

189
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Take it easy, little shop.

190
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Yes.

191
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Sell, be careful.

192
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Don't disturb the giant bubble on my side.

193
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Myy.

194
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Sell, hi, are you okay?

195
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Hi, very funny.

196
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
In what bubble?

197
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:42,000
You should be able to claim those much bigger bubbles for yourself.

198
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
How does the bubble get there?

199
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
You like me.

200
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Cook, cook, cook, cook, cook, cook, cook, cook.

201
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
No dice.

202
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Not when you push harder.

203
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Good, it worked.

204
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Very funny.

205
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
The bubble takes me lightly.

206
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
The bubble does not compress.

207
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
The bubble does not compress.

208
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
The bubble is not thick.

209
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Hihi, let's go somewhere.

210
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Good idea.

211
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Let's join Moomin Valley to show ourselves.

212
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Yes, we get confused there.

213
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
I'm going higher.

214
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Go ahead, Mars.

215
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
The smell is good.

216
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Bend bubbles and straws.

217
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Let's try.

218
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,000
The bubbles went the wrong way.

219
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
A bowl.

220
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Look here.

221
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Look up.

222
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Wet girl.

223
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Niisku, look at the giant soap bubbles.

224
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Beyond belief.

225
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,000
These are real soap bubbles, Niisku.

226
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,000
We borrowed some of your magic liquid.

227
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Or just a little bit, hey?

228
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
That what?

229
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Niisku, your invention is a great success.

230
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,000
The bubbles don't break at all.

231
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Come down now, Miss Niisku, so I can look at your soap bubble.

232
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Later, Niisku, honey doesn't dry out.

233
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
And why not?

234
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:22,000
We have absolutely no idea how we're going to get down from here.

235
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
We learn against.

236
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Take care of yourself bubble.

237
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,000
It's much easier than building an airplane.

238
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Believe it or not!

239
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Typical answer from a layman.

240
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Listen, where are you going?

241
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Oh, snot-nosed!

242
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Moomin Mom!

243
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Moomin Papa!

244
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,000
The Moomin troll is flying in the sky in a soap bubble.

245
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
In a bubble?

246
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Nuska-muikkunen!

247
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Moomin-pikku, möök is there too.

248
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
And my sister.

249
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
What has happened to you?

250
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
There are good views from up here.

251
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,000
That's nice, but you'd better come down.

252
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
They don't seem to be able to.

253
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
How do we give them dinner?

254
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
What if the bubbles burst?

255
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
They won't break.

256
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
How do you know?

257
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,000
After all, the bubbles are reinforced with my sperm.

258
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Niisku-neiti and Myy, try to grab the ladder.

259
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Clear!

260
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
I still want to fly!

261
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:26,000
You can't! You won't start to slow down in time anyway.

262
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Come on now!

263
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Sell, hurry!

264
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Remember, niisku-mistress!

265
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
You'll get a Moomin goblin!

266
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Sell, it went great!

267
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
It scares me.

268
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,000
The bubbles drag the ladder along with them.

269
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
The wind is rising!

270
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Niisku-neiti, don't give up!

271
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
How do you two hit it off?

272
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,000
Hang on, I'll come with you!

273
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Wait!

274
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:07,000
They can fly thousands of kilometers away from Moomin Valley.

275
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Snuff-mum, isn't there any way to get the kids down?

276
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,000
The only option is to call for help.

277
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Could he agree?

278
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
As sure as fate.

279
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
From Markiil!

280
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Bubble bubble!

281
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Bubble bubble!

282
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
We are smashing into a mountain wall.

283
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Let's try to catch the wind!

284
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,000
Maybe we can get over the mountain after all.

285
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:47,000
I want to see what's on the other side of the mountain!

286
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Hey!

287
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Meri!

288
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:22,000
And you never know when your grandma is coming back, do you?

289
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,000
No, it wasn't until dark yesterday.

290
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Why do witches dance in the sky all day long?

291
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
I really don't know where grandma goes.

292
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:34,000
I guess he has some witch jobs?

293
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:39,000
We have to find the witch before the kids wander too far.

294
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
We are drifting into the open sea.

295
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:52,000
This isn't funny at all anymore.

296
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Mikku mie is sleeping.

297
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Moomin and Pekko as well.

298
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Hey, don't sleep!

299
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Moomin, Pekko and Myy, you need to wake up.

300
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
What should I do?

301
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
We will be separated from each other.

302
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Terrible!

303
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
You can't leave me!

304
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Someone's coming this way.

305
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Someone flying.

306
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Witch!

307
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
Just head on like that.

308
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
Who's the fine lady?

309
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Don't fly this.

310
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
I will save me, Moomin, Pekko and Myy.

311
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
Huh, where are they?

312
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
There.

313
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Share, that's how it looks.

314
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,000
And it apparently flies in different directions.

315
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Yes, please help us, please help.

316
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
I can help.

317
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:03,000
If you tell me what that ball you're floating in is.

318
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:07,000
I'll tell you, I'll tell you, but I'll save us first, promise.

319
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
Well, let's start with the past.

320
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
Come help their help.

321
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
Maybe it smelled.

322
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Moomin, papa, I can't get down.

323
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
Same problem as children.

324
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Watch out for the skunk's foam at the mouth.

325
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Fear not, this is not expensive.

326
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
I'm not afraid of water.

327
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Little Myy is fast asleep.

328
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Let him sleep, and he will be less trouble.

329
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Phew, flying witch.

330
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,000
Mother.

331
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,000
Low.

332
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,000
Low-no-go.

333
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
A thousand thanks.

334
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
I can't help anymore.

335
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:00,000
Don't wait for me to get them out of the bubble.

336
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
Oh, you could even try.

337
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:06,000
I'd help if I could, but my witchcraft doesn't feel like it's working, it's bubbling.

338
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
I can probably help with that.

339
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,000
Oh, you're the little cookie.

340
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
And you the famous witch.

341
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:17,000
A scientist who can't even get his own bubbles down from the sky.

342
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:20,000
A witch who can't conjure soap bubbles burst.

343
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Niisku, don't make a joke about it.

344
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:29,000
Excuse me, could I have a candle, scissors and matches?

345
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:40,000
Phew, you don't need a scientist when you use fire and scissors.

346
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,000
But a scientist finds a way to use them.

347
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
Hey, hey!

348
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
Hey, help!

349
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
Oops, more bubbles!

350
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,000
You paps!

351
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
I'm a bonehead.

352
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:00,000
There's a witch down there, look.

353
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,000
There is no joy in seeing her.

354
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:06,000
Shut up, don't make more bubbles.

355
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:10,000
Oh my, please help them down too.

356
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:14,000
A scientist can certainly act as the situation demands.

357
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:17,000
You know I can't fly, that's your hay.

358
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
Help them down.

359
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:22,000
Come on, I guess I have to.

360
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
Thank you, Nisku.

361
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,000
Tell me one thing, how did you get inside the bubble?

362
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:35,000
Well, it was quite easy when the bubbles were fresh.

363
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:39,000
I didn't even know my invention had that feature.

364
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:43,000
Milestone blisters. Maybe it should be left to heaven.

365
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
You can't be that bad.

366
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:48,000
Mouth soup, don't you hear the word?

367
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
Mom, what are they talking about?

368
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:55,000
Don't worry, the witch is fun to annoy a bit.

369
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:59,000
Noita feels very important now.

370
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:03,000
Ouch! What the hell am I doing here?

371
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,000
Oops, now they're coming down.

372
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:18,000
