Pooh, Miss Nisku, look!

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Oh, the storm of the last one has thrown all kinds of debris onto the beach.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Would he be among the treasures?

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Hey, let's go see.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Wait a minute.

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Why?

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Little sell is not.

00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,000

Aaaaaaa!

72
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Et...

73
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
that I freaked out...

74
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
What has happened to the sale?

75
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Did I say something wrong?

76
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
So.

77
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Strange.

78
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Hm...

79
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
myy is in trouble again at Takuu.

80
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Night...

81
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Uhh...

82
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,800
You said you would come with us to the beach.

83
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:54,800
The sea may have brought these shoes to the beach that you like.

84
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:17,600
Oh, how cute. I'll make a lanyard out of shoes too.

85
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:20,400
You have already found a lot of shoes.

86
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:25,000
Listen, Moomin-Pekko, do you know what day tomorrow is?

87
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,200
Well, what?

88
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:30,800
Tomorrow.

89
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:33,800
Tell me, what day is tomorrow?

90
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:36,800
No idea. You just have to.

91
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:39,400
Huh? There is Sell!

92
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:42,000
Hey Sell! Cock Luuru!

93
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,600
He didn't notice me.

94
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:46,000
Myy is somehow awkward.

95
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:46,800
Really.

96
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,400
Where are you going?

97
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:49,600
Let's go after it.

98
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:59,600
What is Myy sitting on the beach for?

99
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:02,200
Myi is suffering from a stomach ache.

100
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:04,800
Nipsu, you usually suffer from them.

101
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:07,400
Sniff, muikkunen, don't bother.

102
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:10,000
Shhh! Be quiet!

103
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:12,600
Hey, look.

104
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:14,000
What do you see?

105
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,400
Look what Myi has in hand.

106
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:18,200
He knows how to calculate.

107
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:30,400
To love, not to love, to love!

108
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:32,600
Myy is in love!

109
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:35,000
What a joke! I'm going to die!

110
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Love is no joke you know.

111
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:41,600
Se he wires!

112
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:44,400
Myy is in love, the best joke in the world!

113
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:49,800
Nipsu, the small shop is also a woman and every woman has the right to love.

114
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:52,800
Of course, but Myy doesn't.

115
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:54,800
A pedant can't love.

116
00:03:56,600 --> 00:04:01,400
A pinch, the pangs of love can wreak havoc on a little girl's heart just as painfully,

117
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:04,400
when they run into my heart too.

118
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:09,600
Well, let's leave it at that.

119
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:12,800
By the way, do you know what day tomorrow is?

120
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:17,000
Well, no, no information. You'd already say marshmallow.

121
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:21,600
Oh, oh you foresters. Valentine's Day, of course.

122
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:22,800
What day is it?

123
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:26,200
Fools! Tomorrow is the only day of the year

124
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:30,000
if you can express your feelings to the object of your love.

125
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,800
I think Myy is fighting with himself.

126
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:36,600
Is Koha hiding her love, or are we letting it out?

127
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:40,400
I don't think so, but what's wrong with the small shop?

128
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:42,400
Well no, I just understand.

129
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:48,600
As long as I'm not the object of Myi's love, it's okay for me to do the same.

130
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:52,200
It would be right for you if Myy loved you.

131
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:57,000
It would be so, but it doesn't seem likely to me.

132
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Myy has loved to the core.

133
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,400
He can't sleep at night, but tosses restlessly on his mattress.

134
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:11,400
You just saw how he sighed while he was away on the beach and didn't pay any attention to his surroundings.

135
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:16,400
Sighing is the first sign of unrequited love.

136
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:20,200
Young hearts reach out longingly towards each other.

137
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:27,800
Overwhelmed by fearsome enthusiasm, the young love-sick person grabs one petal after another from the day's poop and guesses.

138
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:32,400
Will he find love? To love, not to love, to love, not to love.

139
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:41,400
I think that Myy woke up too late in the morning because he couldn't sleep at night because he was afraid of the thunder.

140
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:46,400
And the sigh was because he missed breakfast and was just hungry.

141
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:47,400
A pinch!

142
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:48,400
What?

143
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:50,400
You're not going to be the least bit romantic.

144
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:52,400
Selling doesn't make me romantic.

145
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:53,400
Phooey.

146
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:56,400
Now you say what you think.

147
00:05:56,400 --> 00:06:01,400
Listen, I think there could be another explanation for Myi's behavior.

148
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:04,400
But what it is, it's hard for me to guess.

149
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:06,400
You are right.

150
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:09,400
Myytok also seems as if he is in love.

151
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:10,400
You're right.

152
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:13,400
I don't agree to believe it.

153
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:19,400
Oh, you knit.

154
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:22,400
I'm knitting, tomorrow is Valentine's Day.

155
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:24,400
Is it really?

156
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:27,400
And you knit me something for Valentine's Day.

157
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:28,400
How is it?

158
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:30,400
But what are you knitting?

159
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:32,400
I guess I'll get it.

160
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:34,400
Tell me, mom, what will happen?

161
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:36,400
Then you'll see it.

162
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:42,400
I have a feeling today that I am writing a successful chapter in my memoirs.

163
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:54,400
What's bothering you all?

164
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:56,400
You are so quiet.

165
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58,400
Yes, when...

166
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:00,400
Now where is the problem?

167
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:02,400
Well, that...

168
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:04,400
where is dad

169
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:06,400
Yes?

170
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:10,400
Dad is inspired and wants to eat dinner in his study.

171
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:12,400
And he wants to eat in the evening.

172
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:14,400
And he wants to eat in the evening.

173
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,400
And he wants to eat in the evening.

174
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:18,400
And he wants to eat in the evening.

175
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:20,400
And he wants to eat in the evening.

176
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:22,400
And he wants to eat in the evening.

177
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,400
Tell me what's the matter?

178
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:26,400
Eh, nothing.

179
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:28,400
You're weird.

180
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:30,400
Dad is working, good.

181
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:32,400
Yes, by the way, how does the little one sell?

182
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:34,400
How little does it sell?

183
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:36,400
Are you feeling better?

184
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:38,400
Did you hear Nipsu?

185
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:40,400
Mummy asked, can you sell better already?

186
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:42,400
I heard, I heard, but what did he mean?

187
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:44,400
I heard, I heard, but what did he mean?

188
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:46,400
I sell unrequited love.

189
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:48,400
What are you whispering?

190
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:50,400
The small sale must be used alongside.

191
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:52,400
It is a clear sign that he is in love.

192
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:54,400
Don't be a joke.

193
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:02,400
I feel uncomfortable when the seller is so quiet.

194
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:04,400
I feel uncomfortable when the seller is so quiet.

195
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:06,400
Better to keep your mouth shut.

196
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:08,400
I haven't seen it sold like that.

197
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:10,400
Myi has fallen seriously ill, namely from love's disease.

198
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:12,400
I don't dare.

199
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:14,400
I don't dare.

200
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:16,400
So, so.

201
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:17,900
I don't dare.

202
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:20,400
Did you hear that Moomin mom is asking how the little girl is doing?

203
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,400
Invisible.

204
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:24,400
So I must have said something to Mummy Moomin.

205
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:26,400
Of course!

206
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:28,400
I'll go and ask him right away.

207
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:30,400
Oh, you've noticed too.

208
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:32,400
So when you don't get lucky you jotkyvänustera.

209
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:35,400
I really have a feeling that little Myi is in a lot of pain.

210
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:37,400
I really have the feeling then that my little one is in severe pain.

211
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:39,400
habitats

212
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:41,400
He has completely lost his reed lock.

213
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:43,400
I guessed it.

214
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:45,840
It's good to be kind to the little ones.

215
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:47,920
At least I try.

216
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:54,320
I see! Catching up!

217
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:55,880
Experience!

218
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:59,560
Vain! There is no secret behind other doors.

219
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:02,040
Yes, but the door was open.

220
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:04,000
And the seller is not in his room.

221
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:06,800
Oh, how is it still outside?

222
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:10,240
That's what I've been wondering a bit about here too.

223
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,880
No, you can't.

224
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:17,400
Moomin, don't empty or I'll go through the door.

225
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:20,000
And now I'm selling the room.

226
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:23,320
You played an ugly trick on your leg.

227
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:26,040
You can't go into other people's rooms.

228
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:29,560
What does this mean? What's there?

229
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:31,640
Miss Strike, come here.

230
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:33,720
Short.

231
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:36,160
What is it?

232
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:39,120
Did you find something? Is that a letter?

233
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:41,120
Wait and see.

234
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:43,400
You read it out loud.

235
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:47,760
How could I meet you, O my love.

236
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:50,960
I want to be your people day and night.

237
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:56,240
I could throw to strong arms and forget all about it.

238
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:59,360
i love you i love you

239
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:03,360
I love you the most in all of Moomin Valley.

240
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:05,440
I love.

241
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:08,920
What does this mean?

242
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,200
See what this means.

243
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:14,360
It clearly looks like a love letter.

244
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:17,680
And you didn't write it?

245
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:19,760
What?

246
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:21,840
I knew.

247
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:25,680
Tail star.

248
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:32,880
Wasn't I right all along?

249
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:35,720
I suspect that the seller did not write it.

250
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:38,200
But the letter was found in the seller's room.

251
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:42,880
It would be fun to know what the guy selling is like in love.

252
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:45,760
Nipsu, what's making you laugh?

253
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:47,840
I haven't heard.

254
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:50,520
Can you imagine? What?

255
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:54,240
The guy you hate.

256
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,320
What is he like.

257
00:10:57,320 --> 00:11:01,320
No, no, no, Nipsu. Don't be mean.

258
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:05,400
I shouldn't laugh, but I can't help it.

259
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:09,480
Myy is in love with me as a crack.

260
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:12,560
My stomach skin is tearing.

261
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:14,640
Dude, don't laugh.

262
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:18,720
At least we know a lot of people who are out of the question.

263
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:20,800
What do you mean?

264
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:24,880
Myy could only have fallen in love with someone weird.

265
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:26,920
Like who?

266
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Well, like a skunk.

267
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:31,080
Joo.

268
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:33,160
Why don't you sniff around?

269
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:35,240
How about hemu?

270
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:37,320
Or from a hat rug.

271
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:40,400
Why not? I'm thinking now.

272
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:42,480
They're the same size.

273
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:45,560
Don't joke. I can think.

274
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:49,640
The sensitive youngest maiden cannot fall in love with the hattivat.

275
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:52,720
Let's think another way,

276
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:55,760
who Myi's age lives in Moominland.

277
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:58,840
You are the only one of the same age.

278
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:00,920
Don't count playing.

279
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
If not you, then who?

280
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:05,080
So.

281
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:07,160
Is Myy in love with me?

282
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:09,240
Why not.

283
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:11,320
Who else is left.

284
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:13,400
Hey.

285
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:15,480
Hey.

286
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:17,560
The door is open.

287
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:19,640
We wondered here.

288
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,000
We were worried when you weren't home.

289
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:25,080
We just got stuck.

290
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:27,160
Anna, excuse me.

291
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:42,680
Would Myyn have fallen in love with a Moomin?

292
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:44,760
It's impossible.

293
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:48,840
If I love Moomin, why doesn't Myn love him too?

294
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:51,920
Now there is no waiting for an answer.

295
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Act and I'm ready to fight.

296
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:59,080
Anna, forgive us for trespassing in your room.

297
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:03,160
I'd like to talk to you about that connection.

298
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:05,240
Is the Moomin...

299
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:10,320
Do you know that you are in love with a Moomin?

300
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:15,120
I hope you are not.

301
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:17,200
Say if you haven't.

302
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:19,200
That would make it easier for me.

303
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:21,280
Tell me quickly, please.

304
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:23,360
Short.

305
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:25,440
Nice.

306
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:29,520
Myy.

307
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:31,600
Sorry for bothering you.

308
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:40,960
Oh, that cold look.

309
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:43,040
Freezing silence.

310
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:45,120
Not a word in response.

311
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:48,120
Of course, myi could not confess.

312
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:52,200
There is no catalyst.

313
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:55,280
My dear, dear Moomin.

314
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:57,360
Oh the chosen one of my heart.

315
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:00,440
I won't give you to anyone.

316
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:08,520
Come on, come here.

317
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:10,600
Juhi!

318
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:12,680
I hear these are for you.

319
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:14,680
Thank you.

320
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:16,760
A more fun gift than a card.

321
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:18,840
I can't thank you enough, papa.

322
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:20,920
This package is for you.

323
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Thanks, mom.

324
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:25,080
It's nice that it's Valentine's Day.

325
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:27,160
So do I.

326
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:29,240
Nipsu, here it is for you.

327
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:31,320
Thanks.

328
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:33,400
Get wet, miss.

329
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:35,480
What?

330
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:37,560
Aren't you going to open your own gift?

331
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:39,640
Yes, yes I will open.

332
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:41,720
About.

333
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:43,720
Oh yeah.

334
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:48,800
There's a sale right there.

335
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:50,880
I'm going to take a present.

336
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:52,960
Because he has a package with him.

337
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:55,040
Then I sell the groom.

338
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:57,120
At least it's not a Moomin.

339
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:59,200
Whoah!

340
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:01,280
What happened to you?

341
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:04,360
No. I'm just so happy.

342
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:06,440
Come on.

343
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:09,400
Is the boy going to his friend's house?

344
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:11,480
Of course, today is Valentine's Day.

345
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:13,560
But who lives there?

346
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:17,640
We're finally standing up for what the seller is fighting for.

347
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:19,720
A pinch!

348
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:21,800
Be careful.

349
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:23,880
Doesn't love anyone Moomin.

350
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:25,960
What?

351
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:28,040
Nothing.

352
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:30,120
i love you

353
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:32,200
Look.

354
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:34,280
Pikkuu sells Marsi the tent of Snuskamuikkunen.

355
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:36,360
Hardly a daredevil.

356
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:38,440
Uskamuikkunen wants to be involved in this story.

357
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:40,520
Probably not.

358
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:42,600
Now the seller gives a gift.

359
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:44,680
Five iron.

360
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:46,760
Not even red.

361
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:48,840
Is the sale going?

362
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:50,920
It's like selling if you see us.

363
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
Daredevil!

364
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:55,080
Pretty!

365
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:57,160
Hi, nice to see you. How about you guys?

366
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:59,240
Don't try.

367
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:01,320
Isn't today Valentine's Day?

368
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:03,400
Or what?

369
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:05,480
It probably is.

370
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:07,720
Who did you get such a nice package from?

371
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:09,800
This one?

372
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:11,880
Just recently from a small sale.

373
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:13,960
For sale?

374
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:16,040
What's so funny about that?

375
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:18,120
Now don't bother being silly.

376
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:20,200
I got a small gift from the seller here.

377
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:22,280
But it doesn't mean anything.

378
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:24,360
Really?

379
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:26,440
But this is just a custom that happens once a year.

380
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:28,520
This time it's a much more serious matter.

381
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:30,600
What do you mean?

382
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:32,680
Oh, that men know nothing.

383
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:35,640
That men can be blind and cruel.

384
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:37,720
And you haven't noticed how the sale is suffering because of you.

385
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:39,800
Yeah, so kill once a year.

386
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:41,880
You dare.

387
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:43,960
I am deeply disappointed in you.

388
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:46,040
Same words, boring too.

389
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:48,120
Wait a minute, I don't understand what you're talking about.

390
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:50,200
Listen now.

391
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:52,280
Little My is in love with you so deadly serious,

392
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:54,360
that he can't even eat anymore.

393
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:56,440
The only daredevil, you don't get cold blooded.

394
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:58,520
A recent day.

395
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:00,600
A recent day.

396
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:02,280
punk-faced, you don't get cold vermniej

397
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:04,360
fight against petty love.

398
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:08,600
Not now, wait...

399
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:11,060
I don't understand...

400
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:13,560
... What are you talking about.

401
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:15,960
I knew!

402
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:18,600
I said from the beginning that I would destroy the snuff window.

403
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:20,960
Oh, unload

404
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:22,680
Sell and snuff responsibly

405
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:25,760
I'd just come for a couple.

406
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:28,000
Iksik eato3

407
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,800
sus refuse

408
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:32,800
And the little shop brought me a present from Moominma.

409
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:37,800
Then again we have lost the clue of who the seller loves.

410
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:42,800
I'll tell you, the little girl has never loved anyone. That's the truth.

411
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:44,800
You must be wrong about that.

412
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:48,800
I can detect the symptoms of pet diseases in my eyes.

413
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:53,800
There is not the slightest doubt about it. A woman's instinct never fails.

414
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:56,800
Well, maybe so. Could be true.

415
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:59,800
But why secretly sell his love?

416
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:04,800
The harder he tries to hide it, the more clearly he sees it.

417
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:05,800
Ai!

418
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:06,800
Please explain in more detail.

419
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:10,800
The more natural it tries to be, the weirder it is.

420
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:15,800
I tell you what. Let's ask the seller directly and see how he reacts.

421
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:24,800
Here he is.

422
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:26,800
Hi sell.

423
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:28,800
How are you?

424
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:31,800
Niiskunnunnie, you ask?

425
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:33,800
Neither do I. Moomin can ask.

426
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:36,800
Me? In for a penny in for a pound?

427
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:39,800
Hi myi, we heard you're in love.

428
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:43,800
We are so excited. Who is that? He must be nice.

429
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:46,800
Could you tell me his name? Would you be so kind?

430
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:50,800
Nipsu thought it was about snuff, but it's not.

431
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:52,800
Do not. Did I say that?

432
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:53,800
You said.

433
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:56,800
Moomin, it was you who suggested it.

434
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:57,800
Did I propose?

435
00:18:57,800 --> 00:19:02,800
Well, snuff Muikkunen and Stink are at least out of the question.

436
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:06,800
I thought it was terribly funny when you claimed Hemuli and I sold as boyfriends.

437
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:08,800
Nipsu, that's what you said.

438
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:10,800
I didn't say that.

439
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:13,800
Do you remember who was the funniest candidate for my boyfriend?

440
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:16,800
I remember Hattivatti.

441
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:20,800
Mö and Hattivatti together. Oh, what a ridiculous thought.

442
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:22,800
I agree. Hattiwatt parka.

443
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:24,800
Don't bother selling the parka.

444
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:26,800
Now you are allowed to stop.

445
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:30,800
The hats are mute. At least it would be calmer.

446
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:32,800
Just a one-on-one call.

447
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:34,800
Hey, let's stop now.

448
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:40,800
Quietly! Don't pretend. I can't bear to listen to your kisses.

449
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:46,800
What a relief. I can talk. The throat is healthy again.

450
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:57,800
I didn't know that myi had burned her mouth in the soup and couldn't speak.

451
00:19:57,800 --> 00:20:02,800
It's terrible to listen to other people's speech when you can't even get a word out of your mouth.

452
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:04,800
Sell, forgive.

453
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:07,800
Fortunately, the seller didn't burn his mouth any worse.

454
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:10,800
I forbade him to talk so that he would heal faster.

455
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:13,800
Thanks for that. The day has been calm.

456
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:16,800
A terribly frustrating day.

457
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:22,800
Because every time I even saw you, I felt like talking terribly.

458
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:26,800
So when Eiti thought you were in love when you were down.

459
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:30,800
I thought you were aware of my throat.

460
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:33,800
No, but wait a minute, how to explain a love letter.

461
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:35,800
So yes. What do you say about that?

462
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:36,800
What letter?

463
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:39,800
A love letter I found in your room.

464
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:42,800
Has anyone seen a single strip of my manuscript?

465
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:44,800
The script slips?

466
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:48,800
It happens to be the most important page of the entire novel.

467
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:50,800
A page of a novel?

468
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:54,800
Well, now the riddle of the love letter was solved.

469
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:56,800
Light up a little.

470
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:58,800
Lost strip in the salesroom.

471
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:02,800
In the salesroom? How the hell did it get there?

472
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:04,800
Hi, hi, hi.

473
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:07,800
Oh, the love book was part of the Moominpapa novel.

474
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:10,800
You know that you can die of laughter.

475
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:13,800
It was the worst Valentine's Day in the world.
