1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,660
Muu-mi-pappa, you're looking here!

2
00:00:02,660 --> 00:00:06,900
Ugh, my breath has turned completely white.

3
00:00:06,900 --> 00:00:08,800
Haa!

4
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:13,900
Hey, little myi, you didn't even go out to play with the others.

5
00:00:13,900 --> 00:00:17,760
I don't! I find it boring to play in the sand every day.

6
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:19,660
Leave like that and great!

7
00:00:19,660 --> 00:00:25,420
Do not follow, great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great great!

8
00:00:25,420 --> 00:00:27,500
I'm fine with that!

9
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:29,500
I play in the sand every day.

10
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:32,500
So would you go for a walk with me?

11
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:35,500
I could do some physical fitness.

12
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:38,500
Huh! Or for a walk?

13
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:42,500
Excited! Excited!

14
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:44,500
Come on, body papa!

15
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:47,500
Do we collect berries and colorful leaves?

16
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:49,500
It fits.

17
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:52,500
I know a place where you can find a lot of them!

18
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:55,500
Hello! The Terho collection competition will be held.

19
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:57,500
And if I happen to win...

20
00:00:57,500 --> 00:00:59,500
So what then?

21
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:01,500
You carry me on your backpack.

22
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:07,500
Excellent! And if I win, you get to carry me on your backpack.

23
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:09,500
You know it's impossible!

24
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:11,500
It seems so!

25
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:13,500
Hello! Hello! Hello!

26
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:24,500
Work hard!

27
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:26,500
Joo!

28
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:28,500
Come on!

29
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:30,500
The trick is always so impossible!

30
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:32,500
Luckily you're not!

31
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:36,500
Have a good day, Mrs. Viljonka!

32
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:38,500
Good day!

33
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:40,500
Artists!

34
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:42,500
Artists indeed!

35
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:44,500
Huh!

36
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:46,500
Does it grow wood?

37
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:48,500
Beautiful!

38
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:50,500
Although it doesn't look like wood.

39
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:52,500
Fence a lot!

40
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:54,500
Sell good!

41
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:56,500
It's just a draft.

42
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:58,500
Some sort of outline.

43
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:02,500
Mrs. Viljonkka paints the final speech on the canvas.

44
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:04,500
I feel like that wastes a lot of work!

45
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:06,500
Am I wasted?

46
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:08,500
You can see the trees anyway!

47
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:12,500
Little Neid doesn't seem to have even the most rudimentary sense of art.

48
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:14,500
Hey are you?

49
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:16,500
Why do you need art trees when there are real ones growing around?

50
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:18,500
Art is...

51
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:22,500
It elevates the culture and elevates it spiritually.

52
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:26,500
Let's talk!

53
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:28,500
My spirit is not exalted!

54
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:30,500
A glance is not enough even for you.

55
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:32,500
Excuse.

56
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:34,500
Sell, let's go collect berries.

57
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:36,500
You don't want to bother the bully lady.

58
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:38,500
He has worries anyway.

59
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:40,500
And poof!

60
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:42,500
Viljonkka knows nothing about art!

61
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:44,500
Calm down Sell.

62
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:47,500
Roll up your sleeves, kids!

63
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:49,500
Don't be lazy here.

64
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:53,500
Fresh-from-the-oven cookies.

65
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:55,500
Thanks, mom.

66
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:58,500
Mom, we built a great sandcastle out of sand today.

67
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:00,500
Oh, what fun.

68
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:02,500
I'd love to come see it.

69
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:04,500
Late.

70
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:06,500
Your turn has already called it out.

71
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:08,500
Oh yeah, that's a bummer.

72
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:10,500
Hey, listen!

73
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:12,500
Let's all start molding sand sculptures.

74
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:14,500
And then there will be an art exhibition.

75
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:16,500
An art exhibition at the swimming pool?

76
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:18,500
Absolutely.

77
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:22,500
The topic can be chosen freely when he is modeling with sand.

78
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:25,500
We will have fun if we all participate.

79
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:27,500
Kiwi, kiwi, kiwi!

80
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:29,500
What topic did I come up with?

81
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:31,500
I will make an ice sculpture.

82
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:33,500
I mold flowers.

83
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:34,500
Moominpapa!

84
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:35,500
So?

85
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:37,500
Oh, are you asking Viljonka to come to the exhibition?

86
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:39,500
Of course.

87
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:41,500
Yes, and the children of Viljonka too.

88
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:45,500
Yeah, a sand sculpture exhibition.

89
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:48,500
And it's open to all Moomins.

90
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:51,500
Then we can build a sandcastle on the beach.

91
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:52,500
Fun!

92
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:53,500
It is.

93
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:55,500
Mom, let's go.

94
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:57,500
I have to think.

95
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:59,500
We will discuss it with the children.

96
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:01,500
See you now.

97
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:03,500
Goodbye!

98
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:07,500
See you soon and everyone come to the exhibition.

99
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:09,500
Why not?

100
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:14,500
Now we can give those rossocks some sort of foretaste of real art.

101
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:18,500
We need to enlighten the less gifted mummies.

102
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:23,500
Children, tomorrow you can show others what art is.

103
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:26,500
I'm so excited that my stomach is churning.

104
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:30,500
I have invited you to the beach to make sand sculptures.

105
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:34,500
As a topic, you can choose anything that is Moomin.

106
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:36,500
What would I shape?

107
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:39,500
You can choose the method freely.

108
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:45,500
You can mold with your hands or use a shovel or some other tool.

109
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:48,500
Have fun. It's time until sunset.

110
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:51,500
Good! The lack of time should not surprise you.

111
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:54,500
Ladies and gentlemen, shall we begin?

112
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:56,500
Joo!

113
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:59,500
I look forward to seeing what happens.

114
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:02,500
Moomin papa!

115
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:05,500
Sell, what's wrong? Why aren't you busy with work already?

116
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:08,500
Well, I don't know what to mold.

117
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:10,500
And you yourself haven't started?

118
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:12,500
Yes, I still had time.

119
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:14,500
Dad, that's where the corn is coming from.

120
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:17,500
And childish, of course.

121
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:20,500
I want to understand.

122
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:22,500
I want to understand.

123
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:24,500
I want to understand.

124
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:26,500
And childish, of course.

125
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:31,500
Greetings, Mrs. Viljonkka.

126
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:32,500
Good day!

127
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:36,500
We are honored that the whole family is participating in the project.

128
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:39,500
Oh oh, the joy is all ours.

129
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:41,500
And besides, I thought...

130
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:44,500
Would it be appropriate for you to show us what real art is?

131
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:46,500
Myy.

132
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:49,500
It's a hilarious and terrible street.

133
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:53,500
Great, well, let's get started, please.

134
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:56,500
Everyone else has already started work.

135
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:59,500
Alright, we'll just dress appropriately first.

136
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:02,500
Children, put on your work jackets, now let's start.

137
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:06,500
Well, we are ready.

138
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:09,500
You look like professionals.

139
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:13,500
When you do something, you always have to try to do it seriously, that's how it is.

140
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:22,500
Oh, oh, oh.

141
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:31,500
Now listen carefully.

142
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:36,500
You have to mold your own original and unique sand sculpture.

143
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:39,500
Mom, what does a unique sand sculpture mean?

144
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:42,500
It means the same as unique.

145
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:45,500
What does a unique sand sculpture look like?

146
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:48,500
I have completely understood.

147
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:50,500
Don't ask stupid questions.

148
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:53,500
The point is that you are better than others.

149
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:55,500
Joo!

150
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:57,500
Do you understand?

151
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:59,500
I want to visit the castle.

152
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:01,500
So do I.

153
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:05,500
That will make a great plastic kappa.

154
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:07,500
Completely unfinished.

155
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:09,500
Part of the job.

156
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:12,500
I have understood.

157
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:14,500
Completely unfinished.

158
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:17,500
Can you tell what this is going to be?

159
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:19,500
Of course I can.

160
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:22,500
It's like scrambled egg pudding.

161
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:26,500
Wake up, Hemuli.

162
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:29,500
It's not an egg pudding, but look now.

163
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:31,500
Don't you see?

164
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:33,500
Sorry.

165
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:35,500
It's a chocolate cake.

166
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:37,500
Or what?

167
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:39,500
Not just a tiger cake.

168
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:44,500
And it doesn't look like a flying saucer either.

169
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:46,500
Let it be.

170
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:49,500
I was stupid for even asking.

171
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:51,500
No, not at all.

172
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:54,500
I'm stupid when I can't look.

173
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:56,500
Could it be a radio button?

174
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:58,500
Or a can with heather?

175
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:00,500
What will it become?

176
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:05,500
Well, Nipsu, tell me what you think my work looks like.

177
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:11,500
Now I know. It's a chocolate cake.

178
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:15,500
Doesn't it look like a top hat to you?

179
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:18,500
From a cylinder?

180
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:21,500
Nope.

181
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:26,500
Goodbye.

182
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:33,500
Say what you say. It's a top hat.

183
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:37,500
It's a handbag.

184
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:41,500
It is. What are you making, little girl?

185
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:45,500
It's still a secret.

186
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:47,500
Well then, let's wait.

187
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:53,500
Does this look like a flower?

188
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:57,500
A pinch!

189
00:08:57,500 --> 00:09:00,500
You still haven't chosen a topic.

190
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:03,500
The problem is that nothing pops into my head.

191
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:05,500
What is that?

192
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:08,500
This is it, the heart of winter.

193
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:10,500
Do not.

194
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:14,500
This is going to be amazing.

195
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:24,500
When I look at other people's creations, I am sure that the children's work will be the best.

196
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:28,500
But they are my children.

197
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:33,500
What is it?

198
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:37,500
You would know that if you knew anything about art.

199
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:42,500
It's wet, of course.

200
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:47,500
Bogey? My child doesn't want a statue of that scoundrel.

201
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:52,500
I hope the morko didn't hear. It can be heard for miles.

202
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:54,500
Do you hear?

203
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:56,500
The bastard can come here.

204
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:58,500
King!

205
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:04,500
Your mother has no sense of humor.

206
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:08,500
Now you can do exactly what you want.

207
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:12,500
Yes, but our mother will get angry if we leave the statue unfinished.

208
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:14,500
Agrees.

209
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:16,500
Omaapa on asianne.

210
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:20,500
Uh, full thongs.

211
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:24,500
Now I know what sculpture I will make.

212
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:26,500
It's true.

213
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:29,500
Admit it.

214
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:32,500
Hey, look what you did.

215
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:46,500
Hi everyone, Would you like a cup of tea?

216
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:47,500
It tastes good.

217
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:50,500
I taste these. Help for the heat.

218
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:52,500
What Moomin mom?

219
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:54,500
What has happened to the sale?

220
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:55,500
For sale?

221
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:56,500
True.

222
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:00,500
There it is.

223
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:08,500
The size is already right.

224
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:09,500
So.

225
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:12,500
You've come up with a topic.

226
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:14,500
Quite an artificial topic.

227
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:16,500
Looks like there will be a big sculpture.

228
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:18,500
You guessed it, moron.

229
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:22,500
Did you say dirty?

230
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:24,500
Is that what you mean?

231
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:26,500
Why wet?

232
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:28,500
That you don't understand art?

233
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:31,500
I'm in a grumpy mood and you're not grumpy.

234
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:36,500
Get out of the way of my artistic inspiration.

235
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:37,500
Yes, but...

236
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:38,500
Begging now.

237
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:39,500
Even more.

238
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:40,500
Even more.

239
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:41,500
Even more.

240
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:42,500
Even more.

241
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:43,500
Even more.

242
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:46,500
Say, the thing is visible, hasta you too.

243
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:48,500
Mörkö scares me like a statue.

244
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:51,500
If it turns out to be as bad as it is in real life.

245
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:57,500
It's bad, Messy makes a mess.

246
00:11:57,500 --> 00:11:59,500
The sale seems to be having fun.

247
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:00,500
Fun.

248
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:01,500
Tsvarom!

249
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:07,500
Suomess People Are

250
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:09,500
hurry to finish.

251
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:11,500
You have to get younger.

252
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:18,500
We have fun, but remember that you are real artists.

253
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:21,500
Art is not fun, art is pain.

254
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:26,500
Great art always requires great suffering.

255
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:35,500
Moomin Pekka.

256
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:36,500
What matter?

257
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:38,500
Do you want to see my sculpture?

258
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:39,500
what you

259
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:43,500
No.

260
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:47,500
It looks amazing.

261
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:52,500
It's great that you say that. I was afraid they don't really look like flowers.

262
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:54,500
Are they flowers?

263
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:55,500
So.

264
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:57,500
Yes, yes.

265
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:01,500
I have shown them my sculptures only to you.

266
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:02,500
Just like that.

267
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:06,500
I think the flowers are beautiful, what is in the Moomin laksa.

268
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:08,500
Yeah, probably.

269
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:10,500
Uh, again.

270
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:12,500
Alright, done.

271
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:16,500
Like such a big wet one that other people's eyes are reddened.

272
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:29,500
I'm not wet.

273
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:45,500
Oh, and the weather was so beautiful all day.

274
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:47,500
I think it will rain.

275
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:49,500
What do we do now, Moomin-Daddy?

276
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:54,500
Share, yes. Everyone seems to have their work ready.

277
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:57,500
Let's not stop here, shall we?

278
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:01,500
Then you have to choose the best work of art right away.

279
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:02,500
Ai.

280
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:07,500
Sure enough. After all, we don't know who is the best sand sculpture.

281
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:11,500
No, that's not exactly how I thought about it.

282
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:15,500
It's best to choose so that other people's Eros don't go to waste.

283
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:18,500
The purpose was to organize an exhibition and not a competition.

284
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:22,500
We just wanted to spend some leisurely time together.

285
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:30,500
Even then, the size and highly artistic contribution that my children have made has been completely unnecessary.

286
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:34,500
A screwdriver that we've all done what we can.

287
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:38,500
And I think the result is good, imagination has been used.

288
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:47,500
Don't now. My children's artistic tendencies have not gone unnoticed.

289
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:50,500
Let's clap for this.

290
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:53,500
Oh good unusual.

291
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:55,500
Tunnel, tunnel, tunnel.

292
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:57,500
Listen, kids.

293
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:00,500
Kids, stop now.

294
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:04,500
Your clothes will get wet and dirty, as will your hair.

295
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:06,500
Right here on the spot.

296
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:18,500
Yeah, we're going home now.

297
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:20,500
Goodbye.

298
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:22,500
Like that.

299
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:31,500
Oh poor. Of course, the rain has crumbled all the sculptures.

300
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:37,500
What about that? The tide would have broken them at the latest. We knew that.

301
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:42,500
If I had known that, I would have made my sculpture further from the shore, like the whale.

302
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:44,500
A pinch.

303
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:46,500
Better this way.

304
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:48,500
Oh.

305
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:50,500
Oh.

306
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:54,500
I would have known that, I would have made my sculpture further away from the beach, like the sea.

307
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:56,500
A pinch.

308
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:58,500
Better this way.

309
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:02,500
Who would want to constantly look at sculptures on the beach?

310
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:04,500
They live in memories.

311
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:24,500
Moomin, tell me whose sand sculpture you thought was the best.

312
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:26,500
I don't know.

313
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:28,500
Sorry for being late.

314
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:30,500
Missing sales again?

315
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:35,500
Myy hurriedly went outside when he heard us saying that the rain would spoil the sand sculptures.

316
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:37,500
Yeah, myy took my tent.

317
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:39,500
Or like that?

318
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:45,500
Myy hurriedly went outside when he heard us saying that the rain would spoil the sand sculptures.

319
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:47,500
Yeah, myy took my tent.

320
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:49,500
Or like that?

321
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:56,500
If we had to choose the best sculpture, the little girl's creation might very well win.

322
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:58,500
Will I sell it or not?

323
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:04,500
I agree with Moominpapa. Myunkörkö felt very real, at least to me.

324
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:11,500
No kidding. And the poison looked as orphaned and unhappy as usual.

325
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:21,500
Sound!

326
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:32,500
Rare frequent lightning.

327
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:34,500
I'm a little scared.

328
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:48,500
What the hell was that?

329
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:50,500
What?

330
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:02,500
What's going on here?

331
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:06,500
Is everything okay with Myi?

332
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:09,500
Kummakajo.

333
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:11,500
Moomin, what are you up to?

334
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:13,500
Oh, oh, forest fire!

335
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:21,500
Snuffbox's tent is on fire!

336
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:28,500
No matter what!

337
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:32,500
I can't escape!

338
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:34,500
No matter what!

339
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:39,500
I can't escape!

340
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:57,500
Is the poison out?

341
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:04,500
Poison!

342
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:17,500
Poison!

343
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:34,500
Poison! It is!

344
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:52,500
are you ok

345
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:54,500
Has it happened to you?

346
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:56,500
Phooey.

347
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:06,500
Lightning struck and there was a hole in the tent.

348
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:12,500
Oh, how funny that it didn't happen to you.

349
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:14,500
Mummy Moomin!

350
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:16,500
Excellent!

351
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:23,500
I would have gone to hell, but the poison saved me!

352
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:26,500
What on earth? Poison?

353
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:29,500
Phooey. It's your sand sculpture.

354
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:33,500
No, but real poison! The right one!

355
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:35,500
So yes.

356
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:39,500
You were in fornication mode. How would poison have saved you?

357
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:43,500
I'm telling the truth, the truth, the truth, the truth!

358
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:58,500
It was real poison! It was! There was a problem!

359
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:00,500
You must have been dreaming.

360
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:03,500
It was real poison! It wasn't!

361
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:06,500
Damn whores! Moomin!

362
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:09,500
Aren't they just crazy? No way, now that was poison!

363
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:12,500
Don't sell wait!

364
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:14,500
Hey sell!

365
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:17,500
That's a Moomin! It wasn't poison!

366
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:21,500
It was poison! It was, it was, it was, it was!
