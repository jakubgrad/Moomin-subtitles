1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Oh hell!

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Ai, ai, ai, ai!

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Hey!

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Hi, hi, hi!

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Come help!

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Ai, ai, ai!

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Sai!

8
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Ohoho!

9
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
What is it!

10
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
What is auntie?

11
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Ouch, that hurts!

12
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
The witch arrow struck!

13
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
You have to take care of yourself.

14
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,000
I'm trying to travel to the bottom of the trunk, which is too heavy for my strength.

15
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Bad back, you shouldn't have carried it.

16
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Your back can be done for good today.

17
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
We help as long as you ask.

18
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Excellent, then bring the trunk to my side.

19
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
All right, I'll take it.

20
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
It weighs terribly, what's there?

21
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
The coffin has expired.

22
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
It is, and it's the old stuff in the bottle.

23
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:04,000
All the memories from my dear Sulhonen's and my many trips abroad have been collected in it.

24
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Yeah, I don't have many memories.

25
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Please open the chest.

26
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Oh, what a lot of rubbish.

27
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:26,000
They may look like junk, but to me each item is a precious memory of my Fiance and happy times past.

28
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Oh, how sweet.

29
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
what is today

30
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Leather, we once caught a venomous snake in Africa.

31
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Do you care?

32
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Oh, Traveling was my whole life.

33
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
If only I could one more time.

34
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Oh, yes you can, as long as your back heals first.

35
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Can't get better without a secret medicine.

36
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
I have strong doubts about that.

37
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
What medicine is that?

38
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
And where do you get that medicine?

39
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Ah, if only I could remember, that medicine sparkles beautifully.

40
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
A drug that sparkles?

41
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
I like shiny things.

42
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Quietly!

43
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Does auntie remember what kind of sparkling medicine it was?

44
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Oh, how romantic.

45
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,000
My memory has become very fragile.

46
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:37,000
I think of a twinkling star somewhere in Asia or South America.

47
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
It probably was.

48
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Just like that.

49
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
You promised to help me, remember that?

50
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Yes, yes, but...

51
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Aunt Jenni looks so tired.

52
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
We'd better leave him alone for a while.

53
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,000
This created a puzzle. What are we doing?

54
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Aunt has become a child.

55
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Oh, oh, Moominpappa has fallen into the wrong hands.

56
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,000
At least I don't know the sparkling star medicine.

57
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000
And rubbish Aunt Jenni is an old fool.

58
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,000
I would like to help aunt.

59
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,000
But if he doesn't remember more, it's hard.

60
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Ah, that's about it.

61
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Nuskamoikken, what are we doing?

62
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Could it be this?

63
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
What?

64
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
What do you mean?

65
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Hey, look at the glitter.

66
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Oh, boys, stars!

67
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Amazingly beautiful.

68
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Phew, the reflection of the stars!

69
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
And the water is just river water.

70
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
And it won't change.

71
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,000
I don't understand how Sanko can heal Aunt Jenni.

72
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
I don't understand too much.

73
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Hey, Nuskamoikkunen came up with a better answer.

74
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Something that sparkles.

75
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Once upon a time, perhaps a hundred million years ago,

76
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
stars often fell to the ground.

77
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Much more often than nowadays.

78
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
That's what I've heard it said.

79
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Oh, a hundred million years ago!

80
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Then it's clear.

81
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Thank you, Nuskamoikkunen!

82
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Hi, what happened to you?

83
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
You mean if we go in a time machine

84
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
far enough into the past,

85
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
we can collect star pieces from the ground.

86
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Absolutely!

87
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
A medicine that sparkles and sparkles.

88
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Oh, how romantic.

89
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Good, let's go then!

90
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Sound!

91
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Sound!

92
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Sound!

93
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Sound!

94
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Sound!

95
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Sound!

96
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Sound!

97
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Let's go then!

98
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
What exactly happened?

99
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
I don't know.

100
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
The time machine started as if by itself.

101
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
What was that sound?

102
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
At least I heard Moomin scream.

103
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
The sound came from the basement.

104
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
What what?

105
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
The time machine is gone.

106
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
I guess it's not just Moomin who has gone there.

107
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Yes, and where has he gone?

108
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Help!

109
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Where are we?

110
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Beautiful star flights.

111
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Looks great!

112
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Is this just an order?

113
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Rhino!

114
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
What makes the rhinoceros gallop Tuomainen?

115
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
I can guess!

116
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Varukaa!

117
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Help!

118
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Volcano Eruption!

119
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Beautiful!

120
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
The star flies fiery red.

121
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Let's stop stargazing!

122
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
If a star strikes us,

123
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
we will be flat as a flat!

124
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Sound!

125
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Sound!

126
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
We will be flat as a flat!

127
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
At least we don't get stars from here!

128
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Hold on!

129
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
You hurry! You hurry!

130
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Sound!

131
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Quick deposit!

132
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
You hurry, you hurry!

133
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
You hurry!

134
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
You hurry!

135
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Sender of the Snowman!

136
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
The sender of the snowman?

137
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Hi, you're so white! You remind me of a wild snowman!

138
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:34,000
And I'm a charming snow queen, am I?

139
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:38,000
So when you start to feel like you're so excited, you're so silly!

140
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Ah, food!

141
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Tasty, but cold!

142
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Slips, don't bother! It's never so cold that you don't like food!

143
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:01,000
It just makes me wonder what we've gotten ourselves into.

144
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,000
We may have entered an ice age!

145
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Ah!

146
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
What was that sound?

147
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
There it is!

148
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Lumimies!

149
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Help! The snowman is coming!

150
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
No!

151
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Hey, don't leave me!

152
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Please help us!

153
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Open the doors!

154
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Please be kind and help!

155
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Snowman, eat us now!

156
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Help, help!

157
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Snowman, eat us!

158
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Let's break down the door!

159
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Now!

160
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Oh!

161
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Apparently, our dishes have been suitable for a snowman.

162
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,000
So you're not snowman messengers, are you?

163
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Certainly not!

164
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Snowman, why did you bring us here?

165
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Yes, why?

166
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:42,000
It might have been a bad idea, but I have a feeling that the snowman will lead us to something Dazzling.

167
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
To the glittering one?

168
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
What exactly?

169
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Quick!

170
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,000
You came to us from heaven!

171
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Are you messengers of the stars?

172
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Oh, messengers of the stars!

173
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Oh, how romantic!

174
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
I'll give you some advice!

175
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Stop whining!

176
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:04,000
You must have come to save our village!

177
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
So it must be!

178
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Save us from the clutches of the snowman!

179
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Are we saviors?

180
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Yes, but...

181
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,000
The Snowman has been rampaging here for years!

182
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Unless we offer him Antim, he threatens to destroy our village!

183
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,000
We live in constant fear!

184
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:26,000
How on earth could we small and helpless people do anything?

185
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,000
You are looking for a shining star!

186
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:35,000
They say the Snowman has a star that can destroy our village in the blink of an eye!

187
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Is it the same star you are looking for?

188
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Would you mind?

189
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,000
It must be Aunt Jenni's returning star!

190
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:47,000
It is very possible, but how do we get the star?

191
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:51,000
I think we should at least try to help the villagers!

192
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Good luck with your business!

193
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:58,000
You can come along! Not much use to you, but better!

194
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,000
I won't come! I don't want to be eaten!

195
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:09,000
I trust you! Remember to be careful!

196
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Good luck!

197
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Those who wish us luck, but don't understand how we feel.

198
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
You can always beat it!

199
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:25,000
They even said that we might never come back.

200
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Don't always be so pessimistic and negative about everyone!

201
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:34,000
The Moomin troll is our refuge, and you are not.

202
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Miss Nisku, you are a jerk!

203
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,000
I'm careful! It's slippery!

204
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
You should have said it earlier!

205
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Stop me!

206
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Oh horrible!

207
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Nipsut

208
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
What a bitch!

209
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Oh, what a hoot!

210
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Edifice!

211
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:27,000
A real castle! Oh, there could be a charming prince living there!

212
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Christmas man probably! And the castle is full of chains and prisons!

213
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Well, I don't mind going to the castle.

214
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
You are allowed to leave!

215
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
What for? We're going to the castle!

216
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Phooey!

217
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
It's too late to live now!

218
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Oh, we're high!

219
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Yay, let's restart.

220
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
What if the foot gets wet?

221
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
I have lypeiko being restarted!

222
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
What?

223
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
What is it?

224
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
I didn't do anything!

225
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
What a hurry!

226
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
What's the hurry?

227
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Go all out!

228
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Hurry now!

229
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
What the hell is going on here?

230
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
What happens now?

231
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Johan, now it's strange!

232
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
We're going down!

233
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
We're going down!

234
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
We're going down!

235
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Vuvi, Pekka, what are you on your way to?

236
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
I don't know!

237
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
Somewhere!

238
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Up!

239
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Are you all right?

240
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Don't look down!

241
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Alas!

242
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Now we're going up!

243
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
Vuvi, Pekka, help!

244
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Don't scream, just climb!

245
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
That's the point!

246
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
Slip, do something!

247
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Be brisk and active!

248
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Wow, Pekka!

249
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
Go all out!

250
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Where are you?

251
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
How have they been?

252
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
Have they derailed in that broth?

253
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
Of course they aren't!

254
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
But...

255
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
We can't stay here!

256
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
We need to find Pekko and the little girl!

257
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Oh my!

258
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Wait!

259
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
Are Nipsu and myi safe?

260
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
I suppose so!

261
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
There's the star the villagers were talking about!

262
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
I guess so!

263
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
You finally found your way here!

264
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Help!

265
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Help, luvibies!

266
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
You guys look delicious!

267
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
I'll enjoy you for dessert!

268
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Muvi Pekka, help me!

269
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
Help me, Muvi Pekka!

270
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
I dare you to stop touching my little girl!

271
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
No, it was the sound of a deer!

272
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
What are you trying?

273
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
There's news!

274
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
What on earth?

275
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
Hennona now had such huge amounts of food!

276
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
I imagined you were tall,

277
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
but you're a jerk!

278
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
Forget about appearance,

279
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
but you were brave

280
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
when you dared to come here.

281
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
You're a hearty beauty, Maiden.

282
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
It's also so guarded.

283
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Are you keeping us in your stomach now?

284
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
I like that style.

285
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
Oh right?

286
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
Maybe you're not that stupid

287
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
than I thought.

288
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
He is stupid!

289
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
You obviously don't know retail yet.

290
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
Quietly!

291
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
Oh, is your name little shop?

292
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
Please stay with me!

293
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
If I threaten the villagers,

294
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
we get exactly what we want.

295
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
Please stay!

296
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
Well, let's hear it!

297
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
And you don't keep the villagers in a state of fear anymore!

298
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
Are you really a snowman?

299
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
Do you live alone?

300
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
I live!

301
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
I found this castle,

302
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
but I had no food and I was hungry.

303
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
So that I...

304
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
You always go to the valley

305
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
and you demand treats from the villagers!

306
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
i have to say

307
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
that taking food without working

308
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
is indecent.

309
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
He snipsu!

310
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
You promised anything, I'll take the star!

311
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
Oh no, if you take it, castle gnome!

312
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
You promised anything!

313
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
Anything?

314
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
Watch out, castle gnome!

315
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
What now?

316
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
I didn't do it!

317
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
You pushed me...

318
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
Everyone get out of here!

319
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
Wait!

320
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
Don't leave me alone!

321
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
Start!

322
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
The castle crumbles to nothing but dust!

323
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
It's no use trying to pretend to be a snowman now

324
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
and threaten others!

325
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
You get to start working

326
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
for the benefit of the villagers.

327
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
Do you have to?

328
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,520
Nipsu sometimes speaks sense!

329
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:24,520
Am I talking?

330
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:27,120
Hihihihihi!

331
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:36,400
Are you going back to heaven?

332
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:38,400
Yes, we found the cure.

333
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:40,920
We're in a hurry, better or worse.

334
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:43,160
I could still stay here, but...

335
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:45,480
Ah, ah, ah, ah, asiuuu!

336
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:47,200
It's way too cold here.

337
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:53,000
Hihihi, start telling the story that messengers from the stars saved your village.

338
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,400
That's what we do.

339
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:56,200
Goodbye, Little Myy.

340
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:58,000
Goodbye.

341
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:02,400
And permit man, please remember your own.

342
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:04,000
Be well.

343
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:07,000
Bye!
