1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Dad, what's the matter?

2
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
My leg hurt.

3
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Did you fall?

4
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I fell and broke my leg.

5
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Fortunately, Moomin-Papa's leg didn't break. Just sprained.

6
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Are your feet still hurting?

7
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Joo.

8
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Yes, sprains can develop into a long-term problem.

9
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Yeah, I guessed it.

10
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Sprains tend to be painful. Have a good time. I happen to prepare for a long sick leave.

11
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Well, oh, oh. Is this such a bad thing?

12
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
A hot spring could help.

13
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Oh right?

14
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
There are different types of hot springs.

15
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Some take one or just others to the other.

16
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,000
There are no hot springs in Moomin Valley.

17
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
As far as I can tell, this should be Moominvalley.

18
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
And it probably is.

19
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
There is no hot springs terrain.

20
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Experts are of the opinion that you have exactly them.

21
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,000
There are some kids over there. Let's stay away from them.

22
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Hi kids.

23
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Nipsu, I'll be backpacking.

24
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
I have a question.

25
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
What is it about?

26
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Are there zoom sources out there?

27
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
What are those?

28
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
We have never needed hot springs.

29
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Hot water gushes out of the earth's crust into a spring.

30
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Who heats that water?

31
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
No one. As far as I know.

32
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Remarkable.

33
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
You could quickly make tea from the spring water.

34
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,000
No, no. Sow in a hot spring. It heals.

35
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Can it be bad then?

36
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Me? I don't.

37
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Just find the source.

38
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
For what the hell?

39
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Sources are rare.

40
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Are they?

41
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Own.

42
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
We are driving to build a hotel in Moomin Valley.

43
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:37,000
And then all the people from below flow into the hot water.

44
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Great. A lot of rich people come here.

45
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
If you help us.

46
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
And I rent them towels.

47
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Let's continue the journey. We have a tough job ahead of us.

48
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
The scholar's time is wasted.

49
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Keep your fingers crossed for these.

50
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Hey wait.

51
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:59,000
If you find a hot spring, can dad bathe in it?

52
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
He has sprained his ankle.

53
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Certainly.

54
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Help and communication.

55
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
We are hot.

56
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
This is also fire.

57
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Will come.

58
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Will come.

59
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Will come.

60
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Will come.

61
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Will come.

62
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Will come.

63
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Will come.

64
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Will come.

65
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Will come.

66
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Will come.

67
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Will come.

68
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Hot spring.

69
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Or will they build a hotel if they find a hot spring?

70
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Yeah, isn't that a great idea.

71
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
And in what sense?

72
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Well, because people come here in droves to take a bath and I get to rent them towels.

73
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Then here we start selling ice cream and sausages and you know what.

74
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
And we will be marked on the map.

75
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Yeah, but Dad, a hot spring might be nice.

76
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
You could soak your feet in it.

77
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Share, I'd rather have a sprained ankle than a hotel full of tourists.

78
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Don't worry, there are no hot springs in Moomin Lax.

79
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,000
If there were, we would surely have found them ages ago.

80
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
I believe there are.

81
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:35,000
The men must have had a reason to come here to look for hot springs.

82
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
We haven't explored every place.

83
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,000
If I find the source, I won't tell the men.

84
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,000
But listen, I won't get rich if I only rent towels to you.

85
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Whoops, you don't need to get rich.

86
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Shall we agree not to tell the men?

87
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
I don't think you will find sources before them.

88
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
They are experts.

89
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Besides, I already got permission to rent towels.

90
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
This is good.

91
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
This is mette.

92
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Well, apparently it is.

93
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:22,000
If we could find a hot spring the size of this pond,

94
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,000
we could attract a Moomin square full of tourists.

95
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
If the water is not hot.

96
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:32,000
It seems to me that the word of the experts can no longer be trusted.

97
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
How so?

98
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,000
If it were hot hot here,

99
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:46,000
if there were hot springs here, someone would have found them.

100
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Not necessarily. If they are hidden underground, we have to dig them out.

101
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:56,000
What can I say to that, I'm starting to get into other moods.

102
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:00,000
This Moomin Lauks is the kind of place that really makes you think.

103
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
What the hell is wrong with you?

104
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:08,000
If I were staying here, I would hardly care for the hotel to disturb the peace of the valley.

105
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Have you eaten something inappropriate?

106
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
You think so.

107
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Heartburn can do tricks. Let's go east.

108
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
I hope we don't find anything.

109
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Put a subdetector.

110
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Nipsu, Are you going to come along?

111
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Moomin can get to the world map.

112
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:34,000
That's the last thing we'd want. Don't get it?

113
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Moomin, don't snort.

114
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Thanks to the hot spring, Moomin Valley would become world famous.

115
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
That's not what we want.

116
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:46,000
And besides, I've finally decided to get rich by renting towels.

117
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Moomin troll.

118
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Nipsu is a real tease.

119
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:57,000
I don't want tourists here, but a hot spring would be fun.

120
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
It is said to be good for the skin.

121
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Oh the discipline.

122
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
There are no hot springs here.

123
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
I wish I could be sure of that.

124
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Snuffbox.

125
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:10,000
This matter must be negotiated with Nuuskamuikkunen.

126
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
He's gone.

127
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,000
I haven't seen snuff in the last few days.

128
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,000
True, he is staying invisible.

129
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
He has left.

130
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Stinker, you know where Snuff is.

131
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,000
I don't know, but he left two days ago early in the morning.

132
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Oh yeah.

133
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Why do I look gloomy?

134
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
We would have asked the muikku about something.

135
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Please ask me.

136
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
I don't ask even if I'm aware of the book.

137
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
ha Isu Li, black.

138
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
I wouldn't answer you.

139
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Do you know anything about a hot spring?

140
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Hot or cold.

141
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Hopeless.

142
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Hey, what's that hot spring?

143
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
There is a hot spring.

144
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Wait, you have to tell me.

145
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
A really good find.

146
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
If it gets late, I'll stay the night.

147
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
And you don't, wait, Alipa.

148
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Alisa!

149
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Oh!

150
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Sniff, little one!

151
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
We haven't met for a long time.

152
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Alisa.

153
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
I'm on my way to Moominvalley.

154
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
What about grandma?

155
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Grandma cooks herbs.

156
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Have you joined the ranks of professional witches?

157
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Grandma thinks it's still too early.

158
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
I guess you don't want to be them.

159
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
I want to!

160
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
And I still get that emission certificate.

161
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Sofio, you'll show us around tomorrow.

162
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Certainly.

163
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
So what?

164
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
How about my towel rental?

165
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Wake up!

166
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
We thought you were joking.

167
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
I never play for money.

168
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
You promised I could rent towels.

169
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Hardly.

170
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
We never meant it.

171
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
It was a joke.

172
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
I'll figure this out.

173
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
We meant we could let you

174
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:28,000
buy a license to rent towels.

175
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
I don't have any money.

176
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
We will print a gold coin for you.

177
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
And I own it.

178
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Leave alone. Let's ask someone to help me.

179
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
No, no. Yes, I will help.

180
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
I'll see you early tomorrow morning, Nipsu.

181
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Alisa, you stay with us for the night.

182
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Yes, please.

183
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
I'd really like to.

184
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Moomin will be happy.

185
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Moominpapa, how's your leg?

186
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Better all the time, but horrible

187
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
slowly it will get better.

188
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
It still hurts.

189
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Ah, would my hot spring help?

190
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Hot spring?

191
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Yep, I just found one

192
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
from the river bank to the east of here.

193
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Wake up!

194
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
I soaked myself in the spring and enjoyed it heavenly.

195
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
A wonder and a wonder.

196
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
How so?

197
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
You haven't heard the news.

198
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
What news?

199
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
There are men here looking for hot springs,

200
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
that they could mark Moomin Valley on the map

201
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
and bring tourists.

202
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
It would be exciting

203
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
if they found your hot spring.

204
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
That would be really creepy.

205
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Don't you want Moomin Valley?

206
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
building a big hotel?

207
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Not really.

208
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Would you like to?

209
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
No, and neither does grandma.

210
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
The witch should move out then.

211
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
I can imagine what that would entail.

212
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Guided tour of the witches' cottage,

213
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
where people would line up for fortune cookies

214
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
and to Alisa's corner

215
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
a public toilet would be built.

216
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Elf!

217
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Who has done this and why?

218
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Why?

219
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:46,000
This is really no laughing matter.

220
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Well, it's not.

221
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Sniff, Muikkunen!

222
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Hey!

223
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Oh, Alisa is here.

224
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Hi, nice to see you again.

225
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
I heard you were laughing just now.

226
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:06,000
So we laughed, although there is nothing to laugh about.

227
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
What were you talking about?

228
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Muikkunen, have you already heard of those men?

229
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
I am.

230
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Snuff, Muikkunen, has found a hot spring.

231
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Wake up!

232
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Good morning, Nipsu!

233
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
ha I Su Li!

234
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
What now?

235
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
What's wrong with you?

236
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
How so?

237
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
You always march straight ahead of Muubitalo.

238
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Why today?

239
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
I'm at Takuu, something on your mind.

240
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Looks like you're as sharp as ever.

241
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Yeah, and I'm proud of it.

242
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
I got the wrath of the Moomins on me.

243
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Good!

244
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Don't hang on to them.

245
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
They are high-spirited slobs who are up to no good.

246
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
And your fate is my cover and I reach for the lock.

247
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
I'm not like you.

248
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
If I do wrong, my own feeling bothers me.

249
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Just like a hot spring, right?

250
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Don't run around.

251
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
I'm proud of it.

252
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
I'm proud of it.

253
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Don't run around me.

254
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:36,000
I believe that in this situation the most important thing for us is to prevent men from finding my hot spring.

255
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
It's not easy.

256
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Second, we have to convince them to abandon the plan.

257
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
But how?

258
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
And you can't waste any time.

259
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Let's take action now.

260
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:52,000
It's already too late, but first thing tomorrow morning before the sun has risen.

261
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
What must we do?

262
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
What can we do?

263
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Where is Nipsu anyway?

264
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Helps in hot spring searches. That's covered by the warranty.

265
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
The Stingray Society.

266
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
That bit.

267
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
I tell you what.

268
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Grandma is our only hope.

269
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
The problem?

270
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Sorcery is clearly needed now.

271
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:20,000
I would help if I could, but only grandma can help.

272
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:24,000
I'm sure everything will end happily with your grandma's help.

273
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:28,000
I don't know. It would be in the witch's interests as well.

274
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Without further ado, let's ask the witch for help in a very nice way.

275
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Yeah, let's put Alisa on it.

276
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Grandma will definitely help us.

277
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:40,000
He doesn't want people to start flooding here.

278
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Don't worry at all.

279
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Do you want me for support?

280
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
What do you mean?

281
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Well, that your grandma would believe better.

282
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
But remember, I'm talking.

283
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Tell him all the trees would be cut down and the sun would shine on your cabin all day.

284
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Tell them that they would build a public toilet in the yard.

285
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Stop worrying already. I'll tell grandma everything.

286
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
He is not shy at all.

287
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Don't tell me we set you up.

288
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
I'm not stupid either.

289
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
It can be nice to drop by the hotel.

290
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Yes, but all the trees might have to be cut down before the hotel could be built.

291
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:30,000
True. It would be fun if the trees didn't block the view.

292
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
You are lying!

293
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:36,000
It's so quiet and boring here, tourists would bring a little change.

294
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
It could be difficult.

295
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
It can be tricky.

296
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
It can be tricky.

297
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
It can be tricky.

298
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
It can be tricky.

299
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Repeaters would make a bit of a difference.

300
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,000
I could sell them something to drink.

301
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
Grandma, don't!

302
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:56,000
I'm thinking now. The music refreshed day and night.

303
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:02,000
People would throw so much garbage that we could use it to heat the cabin through the winter.

304
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Grandma, don't talk about hay.

305
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:07,000
You don't mean what you say and that pisses me off.

306
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Moomin troll.

307
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
So?

308
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Does your mind say anything about how the ancestors of the source could be expelled?

309
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Oh, are you willing to drive them out of here?

310
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Well, for sure.

311
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,000
I think witch-like powers are needed.

312
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Maybe you could scare them away.

313
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Hmm, you could try that.

314
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:36,000
You would let them understand that Moomin Valley is not really a pleasant tourist destination.

315
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
It's not an easy task.

316
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:45,000
If you slipped into their tent sharp, hissing, disgusting-looking, slithering spikes.

317
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
I'm all for sharpies.

318
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Nothing more crazy, but you can get rid of the sharp ones.

319
00:16:50,000 --> 00:17:00,000
Maybe you could do something about the weather if you made them think that Moomin Valley has a miserable climate, always disgustingly cold or hot for tourists.

320
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Hmm, ugh, dangerous.

321
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
Is it too hard?

322
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:09,000
Nothing is too difficult for a witch.

323
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Mmm, a beautiful day will do. I'm in a great mood.

324
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Hey, get out of there, beautiful...

325
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
I can't hide now.

326
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
A typical holiday.

327
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
You dumbass!

328
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
Tent!

329
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
Back!

330
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
So much laccase.

331
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
Tent!

332
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
So much laccase.

333
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:08,000
The tent was gone.

334
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,000
I've never seen anything like that there.

335
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
No hail!

336
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Ax!

337
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
Raikkuura from a clear sky.

338
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
Good luck.

339
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
Salamoi.

340
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
Good luck.

341
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
Hard to believe.

342
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
Lunto this is clearly.

343
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
How cold?

344
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
Live, live.

345
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:01,000
Oh dear. I should be there for my friends, but today might be my only chance.

346
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
Good morning.

347
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
I can't take it anymore.

348
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
Now don't let it.

349
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
I'm starting to have enough.

350
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
Hello, beautiful day.

351
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
Nissu, come to the rescue.

352
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
Yes?

353
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,000
You were a piece of cake when you ran through the snow.

354
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:24,000
What? I don't see snow anywhere.

355
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:28,000
Söfeera, I've never seen snow like that again.

356
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
This is the end of it all.

357
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
God!

358
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:48,000
I plodded, plodded, pill, pöller.

359
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
It's okay, it's okay.

360
00:19:55,000 --> 00:20:01,000
Those looking for hot springs never returned to Moominvalley.

361
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:14,000
Moominpapa can't stand to stay away from the hot spring, even though his ankle has been healed for many weeks.

362
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:19,000
He doesn't even care to start writing his memoirs again.

363
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
Thanks for watching.
