00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,320
beiwaterikko

2
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:13,320
How nice.

3
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:18,400
Mamma, I find it enjoyable to drink coffee at the same time every day.

4
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:20,520
Well, about me too.

5
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:23,160
Dad, why is it so enjoyable?

6
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:27,440
My son, it shows that the world remains unchanged.

7
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:29,560
At least in Moominvalley.

8
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:31,560
Why do you like immutability?

9
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:34,560
I don't miss the same thing twice!

10
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:39,560
Dad likes disasters and excitement, but he enjoys his cup of coffee just the same.

11
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:43,560
I would like to experience as many adventures as my father did back in the day.

12
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:48,560
Speaking of which, Moominpapa, you haven't told me everything about your youth.

13
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:49,560
I want to hear!

14
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:51,560
Tell me, father please!

15
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:52,560
Well, let's see.

16
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:56,560
Moomipappa, and you didn't even meet someone like me when you were young?

17
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:58,560
Like you?

18
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:00,560
Oh yes, I met.

19
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:02,560
Or what?

20
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:04,560
Does Moomimama know him?

21
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:07,560
Father, continue your story!

22
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:12,560
Well, it's fine if you really want to hear about my youth.

23
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:15,560
Remember where we left off last time?

24
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:18,560
You said your house was haunted!

25
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:20,560
Oh, let's forget the ghosts.

26
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:22,560
Support, your ear if you're scared!

27
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:24,560
Well, not now!

28
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:29,560
So we had settled down on King's Island.

29
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:32,560
And there we had to form a colony.

30
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:37,560
But I didn't quite understand what the colony meant.

31
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:41,560
I asked my mother what to do in the colony.

32
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:42,560
Well, what?

33
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:47,560
There must be many of you and you must live very close to each other.

34
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:48,560
Yes.

35
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:50,560
And then there was a fight here!

36
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:53,560
Why? Do we have to?

37
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:55,560
I don't like arguing.

38
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:58,560
Strange if you have to argue.

39
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:04,560
I don't agree. I have no desire to argue with anyone.

40
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:07,560
In that case, I'm going to live separately.

41
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:09,560
That's wrong!

42
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:11,560
Well Juksu, what do you say?

43
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:16,560
In my opinion, everyone can live and live in the settlement as they want.

44
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:18,560
Are you sure?

45
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:24,560
We are all completely free beings, and at least I won't start arguing.

46
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:27,560
Still don't live very close.

47
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:33,560
Ice cream!

48
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:41,560
Well who is he?

49
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:44,560
Sosuli! He lives in the southern tip of the island!

50
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:47,560
I think Hosuli has set his sights on her!

51
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:50,560
What is Frederikson talking about?

52
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:54,560
Frederikson is hastily building an amphibian.

53
00:02:54,560 --> 00:03:01,560
On the king's order, Frederikson had moved to the surprise park and built feverishly there.

54
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:04,560
We barely saw each other.

55
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:11,560
A colony, but there are quite a few of us.

56
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:21,560
What is it?

57
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:24,560
Was it a ghost?

58
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:26,560
It was.

59
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:50,560
What is it?

60
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:53,560
Could it be a ghost?

61
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:56,560
Could it be a ghost?

62
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:59,560
Could it be a ghost?

63
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:02,560
Could it be a ghost?

64
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:05,560
Could it be a ghost?

65
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:08,560
Could it be a ghost?

66
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:11,560
Could it be a ghost?

67
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:14,560
Could it be a ghost?

68
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:16,560
Oh!

69
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:32,560
Tonight is Lea?

70
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:37,560
Embrace the revenge of the bones of the dying forgotten.

71
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:39,560
Do you have a cold?

72
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:41,560
I probably am.

73
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:43,560
It will pass.

74
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:47,560
Aren't you afraid of me at all?

75
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:50,560
It's hard to be afraid of someone who sneezes.

76
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:55,560
Really? No one can tilt chains in this kind of weather.

77
00:04:55,560 --> 00:05:01,560
But to choose your fate the next time I come and slam my squishy paw down your throat.

78
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:06,560
Oh, are you coming back? When can you come?

79
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:12,560
I thought maybe next Friday at midnight.

80
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:15,560
It's fun. I invite my friends to the haunted house.

81
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:16,560
Your friend?

82
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:20,560
Exactly. I guess you want to haunt more than one person.

83
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:25,560
Well, yes, but that's fine.

84
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:29,560
So I'll be back next Friday.

85
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:40,560
Oh, it will be a very nice surprise for everyone.

86
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:44,560
Be careful!

87
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:53,560
Ipsu, hi Ipsu, Ipsu, you can listen again.

88
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:55,560
The ghost has already left.

89
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:57,560
Did the ghost return on Friday?

90
00:05:57,560 --> 00:06:04,560
Oh, it did come back. That night I had decided to wait for the ghost outside.

91
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:10,560
I haven't really invited you because I'm offering you dinner.

92
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:13,560
Well, that explains the fact that the fish didn't taste like anything.

93
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:16,560
Why have you invited us?

94
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:19,560
That you might experience something really scary.

95
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:22,560
Oh, wonderful! I want scares!

96
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:26,560
Keep what you get. This is where the real ghost appears.

97
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:27,560
What?

98
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:30,560
Oh, did you hear that? Jukra, that's something!

99
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:37,560
Moomi, don't count the slider. I don't like ghosts. You do know.

100
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:39,560
I'm not counting the slider.

101
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:42,560
Look everybody over there.

102
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:48,560
You spoke the truth.

103
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:49,560
Where is it?

104
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:52,560
The ghost is right behind there now.

105
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:57,560
Unlock the Revenge of the Forgotten Bones!

106
00:06:57,560 --> 00:07:02,560
It's wonderful to finally meet a real ghost! Will you take the deal?

107
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:06,560
It wasn't supposed to go like this.

108
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:14,560
When you saw me, you should have barked and screamed and yelled at them.

109
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:19,560
Oh yeah, he knows how to behave. Thanks.

110
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:21,560
No, don't bother coming any closer.

111
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:26,560
I'm a little disappointed too. I thought everyone would be scared.

112
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:34,560
Maybe I wasn't that scared, but I was really amazed at how that ghost hovers above the earth chamber.

113
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:38,560
I wish my amphibian could move the same way.

114
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:45,560
Listen Moomin, can't a ghost move in with you? The colony would get one more member.

115
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:48,560
Good idea. Could you scare us anytime?

116
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:50,560
I recommend!

117
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:56,560
The same if Moomin has proper heating. Disgusting catch a cold.

118
00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:00,560
But Moomin, then I can't visit you.

119
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:05,560
You have to because you're the only one who's afraid of me.

120
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:07,560
Don't come any closer.

121
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:11,560
And that's how I started living with a ghost.

122
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:18,560
On Midsummer's Eve, I was reading a book and the ghost was sitting knitting. According to him, he calmed his nerves.

123
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:21,560
Moomin! Moomin!

124
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:22,560
Hey!

125
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:26,560
Fredriks has finally finished the amphibian.

126
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:27,560
Oh, is it?

127
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:33,560
The king himself performs the descent into the waters and then also consecrates the hosul and sosul.

128
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:36,560
Initiates the hosul. Wait, I'll come down.

129
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:40,560
Is hosulin going to get married? Since he decided it?

130
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:46,560
The king actually just decided it. He's so into weddings and stuff.

131
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:09,560
Tol molt is fine.

132
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:15,560
Toin you are halvalights!

133
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:20,560
In the second part we can eat uczitt strengthening.

134
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:29,560
Even if the floor glove is kann'Da to do the biggest kavaddaming Down.

135
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:34,560
What is Olen lyhotivealis ja.

136
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:37,560
Change the buttons.

137
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:52,560
Congratulations. Now you are husband and wife.

138
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:57,560
Good luck, Hosuli!

139
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:00,560
Thank you very much.

140
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:02,560
I didn't know about your marriage intentions.

141
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:06,560
I can imagine that the desire to get married strikes quite unexpectedly.

142
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:09,560
Not to me, at least.

143
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:16,560
Hosuli! You will have the honor of revealing my ship! It's my wedding cake!

144
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:19,560
Oh, thank you, Frederikson.

145
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:22,560
My dear foolish subjects.

146
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:27,560
We now solemnly launch our own invention Fredrikson's Amphibian.

147
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:32,560
It travels along the ground, dives under water and also flies in the air.

148
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:34,560
Long live Frederikson!

149
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:43,560
No, Hosuli ja Sosuli.

150
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:01,560
Tell me what you think of my new sea spray.

151
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:03,560
That's great, Frederikson.

152
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:05,560
Everyone step into the Amphib!

153
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:07,560
Clear!

154
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:29,560
Sosuli!

155
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:31,560
Sosuli!

156
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:33,560
Sosuli!

157
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:35,560
Sosuli!

158
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:37,560
Sosuli!

159
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:39,560
Sosuli!

160
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:41,560
Sosuli!

161
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:43,560
Sosuli!

162
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:45,560
Sosuli!

163
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:47,560
Sosuli!

164
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:49,560
Sosuli!

165
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:51,560
Sosuli!

166
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:53,560
Sosuli!

167
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:54,560
Sosuli!

168
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:56,560
Sosuli!

169
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:05,560
Does he fly this?

170
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:07,560
Fly... ...look carefully.

171
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:09,560
Let's go.

172
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:25,560
Make fun of us hitting the beach.

173
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:27,560
I'm just at peace.

174
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:39,560
It flies!

175
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:41,560
It flies!

176
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:43,560
So fly! Fly for real!

177
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:45,560
Frederikson, you did it!

178
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:47,560
Amphibian works great!

179
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:51,560
We're not getting any higher, Frederikson!

180
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:53,560
Nothing will come of it.

181
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:55,560
It's nothing.

182
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:57,560
It's nothing.

183
00:12:57,560 --> 00:12:59,560
It's nothing.

184
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:01,560
It's nothing.

185
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:03,560
It's nothing.

186
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:05,560
It's nothing.

187
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:07,560
Nothing will come of it.

188
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:09,560
The engines did now no longer.

189
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:21,560
We're going down!

190
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:24,560
In Ke

191
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:36,560
I'm important.

192
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:37,560
We are not underwater.

193
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:39,560
Look.

194
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:50,560
What is a fish?

195
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:55,280
For you

196
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:58,400
A-la-la-la-la

197
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:02,560
Vaa

198
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:06,240
A-la-la-la-la

199
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:09,640
Wow, la, la, la

200
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:13,000
Elected

201
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:23,560
Let's surface again.

202
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:25,560
Which one was it in?

203
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:53,560
Edvard, hi!

204
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:55,560
What are you doing here?

205
00:14:57,560 --> 00:15:01,560
Are you possibly coming to Hosul's wedding?

206
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:03,560
Sano!

207
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:07,560
Do you like weddings?

208
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:09,560
It's fun.

209
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:11,560
Do you like weddings?

210
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:13,560
It's fun.

211
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:15,560
Do you like weddings?

212
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:17,560
It's fun.

213
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:19,560
Do you like weddings?

214
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:21,560
It's fun.

215
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:43,560
And then our colony got one more new member.

216
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:47,560
That fall, it rained heavily and storms raged.

217
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:49,560
The water was high.

218
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:57,560
Before long, everyone was in my house, which, needless to say, was the best built.

219
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:15,560
It would eventually be ordered to stop.

220
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:17,560
It would eventually be ordered to stop.

221
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:20,560
Good, here's the bed ready for you.

222
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:22,560
Good, here's the bed ready for you.

223
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:24,560
Thanks a lot, Moomin.

224
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:29,560
Funny, this house of mine used to be the wheelhouse of a sea spray.

225
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:33,560
We have never had such bad gale before.

226
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:35,560
We have never had such bad gale before.

227
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:46,560
Go out on an inspection tour.

228
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:53,560
I stepped onto the beach as if I had a premonition of something.

229
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:15,560
Baby!

230
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:37,560
Baby!

231
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:45,560
Baby!

232
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:01,560
My handbag!

233
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:03,560
Save my handbag!

234
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:05,560
Save my handbag!

235
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:09,560
It's on your arm.

236
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:13,560
The shin is here to see, Anki.

237
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:18,560
A puff of water plays from the tuba.

238
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:33,560
Vivawanambo Henri.

239
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:36,560
Even the hardest workers have to be there.

240
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:45,560
Oh, thanks for saving me. What is your name?

241
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:47,560
I'm Moomi.

242
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:54,560
I noticed the witch had a girl with whom I could start a colony.

243
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:06,560
This girl looked so beat up.

244
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:12,560
It was. Even without the bangs, he looked exactly the same.

245
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:15,560
And she was very attractive.

246
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:16,560
It was.

247
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:18,560
What happened to that girl?

248
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:25,560
I carried her to my house, of course, and there we began to live happily.

249
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:30,560
Moomi papa, I strongly doubt that girl was...

250
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:35,560
Nuskamuikkunen and Nipsu, are you going to eat from the air?

251
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:38,560
Is something crazy?

252
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:40,560
The girl was Moomin!

253
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:42,560
And so she became my mother.

254
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:44,560
I, Momi Mamma.

255
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:47,560
Dad, so you told them.

256
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:50,560
Yeah, I just told you how we met.

257
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:52,560
I'm embarrassed.

258
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:55,560
And this is where I end my memoir this time.

259
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:58,560
What happened to the baby?

260
00:19:58,560 --> 00:20:00,560
And for Mymmel's daughter!

261
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:08,560
After meeting Moomi mamma, my days as an adventurer were over, and we have lived happily ever after together.

262
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:12,560
Now it's your turn to create your own stories.

263
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:18,560
And then Papa Moomi fell silent.

264
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:26,560
Moomi the goblin decided that she would follow in her father's footsteps and experience as many adventures in her youth.

265
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:32,560
Thanks for watching the video!
