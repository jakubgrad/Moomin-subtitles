1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
The morning looked beautiful. Miss Niisku was in a good mood.

2
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Wet girl!

3
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
So!

4
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Humid! What is it?

5
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Where in the heck is that basket?

6
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,000
What basket?

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Bread basket. I went to work and I want a basket for my lunch, but it's nowhere to be found.

8
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Did you look at the skateboard?

9
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Of course.

10
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Weird. Where did I see that last?

11
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
You put things in their proper places. You always lose them.

12
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:53,000
And I won't waste! Hear the breeze, you have to come up with a basket that will never go to waste.

13
00:00:53,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Me? A basket that won't go to waste even for my naïves, so it's...

14
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Solve the problem before you go to work. Bye.

15
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Niisku-neiti, you pissed me off.

16
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
I'm going to the Moomin troll now. Bye.

17
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Congratulations! I need to get a basket!

18
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Hey hey hey.

19
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Assu-come

20
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Looks like our basket.

21
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
It's our basket!

22
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Hey dude!

23
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Hey wet girl!

24
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Isn't that our basket?

25
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,000
It might be. It was lying in the corner of the niisku shed.

26
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Well, you should have guessed it from the trail.

27
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Congratulations! Need it in the basket!

28
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Give it back!

29
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Later! The basket fits perfectly into the bill.

30
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
What's bothering you?

31
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Häijyläinen.

32
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Adapted from niisku-girl.

33
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
It was a sell.

34
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Moomin, stop selling!

35
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
What? Slip!

36
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Moomin!

37
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Help me up!

38
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Take this direction!

39
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Later, we will!

40
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Wet girl!

41
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Give the basket back!

42
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Paragraph! I'm on a good run now!

43
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Cory-oops!

44
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Later, come back!

45
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Come on!

46
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Oh, that's where the hell went!

47
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Admit it!

48
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Congratulations! Sell!

49
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
I can't! Today I have restless legs!

50
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
So yes.

51
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
The little mole was like being stung by a wasp.

52
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Sell! where are you

53
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Little sell, answer!

54
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Moomin!

55
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Excuse me, has the sale been seen?

56
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
It isn't!

57
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Well, oh, thank you!

58
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
What has happened to the sale?

59
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Are there families in hiding?

60
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Never work!

61
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
what are you doing

62
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Sell, I found you!

63
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Dirty laundry!

64
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Myy!

65
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Stop young man!

66
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Look, you're not going anywhere until you've washed the sheets!

67
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Me?

68
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Just you!

69
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Yeah, the hell sells.

70
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,000
You shouldn't have started doing laundry.

71
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,000
I don't understand what has happened to Pikku.

72
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
And where has he gone.

73
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Myy!

74
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
No one can catch me today!

75
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
I blow like a storm wind!

76
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
I can!

77
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
You can't escape!

78
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Wait a minute!

79
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Moomin!

80
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
What is yours?

81
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
My paw!

82
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Did you mix it up?

83
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Look what you did to Moomin!

84
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Apologize immediately!

85
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
I'm not pushing Moomin now!

86
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
He fell in his own time!

87
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:57,000
I scared Moomin, what if the leg is broken!

88
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Yes pah!

89
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
From a big crash!

90
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Hey sell!

91
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
I could have been hurt too.

92
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Did you get up?

93
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
We have to carry him home.

94
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Oh Moomin!

95
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
We can't do this alone.

96
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
We need to get help.

97
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Hello! What's up with mymmels?

98
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Help!

99
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
We need help!

100
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Help!

101
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Police case!

102
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Hey!

103
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Papa, would you like to taste this broth?

104
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
So what!

105
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Really good, suitably seasoned.

106
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,000
I wanted to try one new recipe.

107
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
You always cook tasty food.

108
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Thanks papa.

109
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Moomin papa!

110
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Moomin went bad!

111
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
what is

112
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Moomin!

113
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Carefully!

114
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Hi parka!

115
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Paw swelling.

116
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
I can leave.

117
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Anyway, thanks for the help.

118
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,000
And I didn't even offer tea.

119
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Thank you, once again.

120
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Get well soon, Moomin.

121
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Thanks, I'll try.

122
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
I would meet.

123
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Thanks again.

124
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:59,000
I'll have a small talk where I'll see him.

125
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Moomin huts Uncle

126
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Let it hurt.

127
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Well, the wrap is almost in place.

128
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Moomin rukka, are you leaving the poo and Kielmäszämo?

129
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,000
The little one has started to crow.

130
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
I'll take the guesswork out of him.

131
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
So you can't do anything to me.

132
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,000
What are you looking at there?

133
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Are you sure you don't want to stay in the Moomin House?

134
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Myy?

135
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Mii!

136
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Mymmeli, Did you see the sale?

137
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,000
I did, but he was in a big hurry.

138
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
He is always forced to.

139
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Has my sister done bad things?

140
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Well, sort of.

141
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Please.

142
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Oh great, pumpkin soup made me feel like it.

143
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Be careful, it's hot.

144
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Can I get nothing but soup?

145
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Oh, oh, oh, oh, I'm being silly.

146
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:30,000
You and the scumbags are healthy.

147
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Why only get soup for dinner if you've sprained your ankle?

148
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Good appetite.

149
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Thanks as well.

150
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Looks delicious.

151
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Good.

152
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Thanks for the food.

153
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
See you tomorrow Grandma Pekka.

154
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Just bye.

155
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Beautiful dreams.

156
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Didn't come sell tonight.

157
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Well, Mymmeli, he would hint in that direction a bit.

158
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,000
I have no desire to see it sold.

159
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,000
He is still ours.

160
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Boy, you've gotten heavy.

161
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Or old of you.

162
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Don't be silly.

163
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,000
I hope I don't have to carry you for others.

164
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,000
You have to, I won't be walking tomorrow.

165
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Oh, sometimes you sound just like your father.

166
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:38,000
A compression bandage and grandma's liniment will heal your ankle mountain for sure.

167
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Grandma Peikko, don't bother to hold a grudge against me.

168
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,000
He must be miserable.

169
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,000
I have no comments.

170
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Myyy, where are you?

171
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Little Myyy.

172
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Hey Mymmeli.

173
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Ylta, have you seen the sale?

174
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:05,000
No, I haven't seen anyone from the Moomin house in a while.

175
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:11,000
If you see a sale, have you seen the Moomin house people?

176
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:16,000
No, I haven't seen anyone from the Moomin house in a while.

177
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:21,000
If you see sales words, the food is ready.

178
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Joo.

179
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Mymmeli, right away you can come and tell the seller your business.

180
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,000
From heaven.

181
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Myyy, Little Myyy.

182
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Hey, hum.

183
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Cherish me.

184
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Mimmel.

185
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Let's wait.

186
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Don't miss a minute.

187
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Grandma Goblin, listen, I'll put his foot in there.

188
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Me.

189
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Me.

190
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Me.

191
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Goblin, listen, I'm going to hurt my leg because of you there.

192
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:12,000
You come home right away and in the morning we go to apologize to Grandma Peiko.

193
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Me.

194
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
I don't want to.

195
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Pit me now.

196
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,000
It wasn't my fault. And it wasn't, and it wasn't.

197
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Mimmel.

198
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Let the sale stay. He can stay here for the night.

199
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
But?

200
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,000
I'm sure he'll want to go home tomorrow.

201
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
What? It's a hill.

202
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Are you going? If nothing is too much trouble.

203
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
No.

204
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Let's go tomorrow Mummi and have a look.

205
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
You're a nice snuffling muikkonken.

206
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Good night.

207
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Let's eat.

208
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Yesterday's fart is fine for you.

209
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
About.

210
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Well, doesn't it taste good?

211
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Don't rush. There's no rush.

212
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Speak up.

213
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Dad was right. It doesn't hurt at all.

214
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Are you awake?

215
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
I am.

216
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:55,000
So when Eiti came, can you go for a walk down?

217
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
I guess if you help.

218
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Does it still affect the leg?

219
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
Yeah, it's timid.

220
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Oh dear.

221
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Mmm.

222
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
what are you doing

223
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Today I'm cooking, since I was allowed to stay here for the night.

224
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
You don't have to.

225
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
I already cooked.

226
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Eat. There shouldn't be anything wrong with that.

227
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
I'm going for a walk.

228
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Don't you eat?

229
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:53,000
I don't. I'm not hungry now.

230
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:02,000
I'll just do the laundry first.

231
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
I stand up.

232
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Thank you, Niis kun Eiti.

233
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Is it too tense?

234
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Not at all. All well and good.

235
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Except it hurts terribly.

236
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:36,000
I will tell Pikku Myi what's going on and who's giving orders when I see him.

237
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Is Myy back?

238
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
And I don't care if I don't come back.

239
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,000
And unless he apologizes, I'll stay.

240
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Really cheap to taste.

241
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:51,000
I came to apologise, but now it would be my turn to go and start.

242
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
Well then, don't apologize.

243
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
I took the knife.

244
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
It's good if you have the same voice.

245
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
I feel sorry for you.

246
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
That's the point here.

247
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
Oh Myy, wait.

248
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Don't disappear again.

249
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Don't disappear.

250
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Don't disappear.

251
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
Don't disappear.

252
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Don't face.

253
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
Don't disappear again.

254
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
The Moomin troll is going crazy!

255
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Listen.

256
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
What the hell?

257
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
Muomi-peikka

258
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
What?

259
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
Doesn't it live there anymore?

260
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:47,000
I can't sleep after I've been motionless all day.

261
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:24,000
It's not fun to play alone. Snuff may still be around.

262
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
He is awake.

263
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Myy, why don't you go back to the Moomins already?

264
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Yes, but yes, I'll leave Nuuskamuikkunen right away if I'm a problem for you.

265
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:43,000
I don't care, but the Moomins are worried about you.

266
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:47,000
The cat containers are worried about the Moomins, not me.

267
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
Moomin's leg is still sore.

268
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,000
You need to apologize.

269
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:00,000
We will never forgive me.

270
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
Mummy Moomin!

271
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
Hm?

272
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
Good morning!

273
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
Good morning!

274
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Has Moomin woke up?

275
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
On.

276
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Oh, isn't it with you.

277
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,000
He ran early in the morning with a happy mind.

278
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
He continues.

279
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
He continues.

280
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
He continues.

281
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
He continues.

282
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
He continues.

283
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
He continues.

284
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
Haha!

285
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:43,000
I go out early in the morning with a happy mind.

286
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
Ai!

287
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
I ordered them when making crutches.

288
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
Geecha!

289
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Whoah

290
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
Who from there?

291
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
Who from there?

292
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
Yep! That's what I got!

293
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
Sirä!

294
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:34,000
Me too, I guess you weren't scared.

295
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
How about? Foot?

296
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,000
Ha, it's been healthy for a long time.

297
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,000
What?

298
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:44,000
I've only pretended. I wanted to scare you.

299
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:48,000
Father and mother are worried about you, and so am I a little.

300
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
Really?

301
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
And nick lady and nip.

302
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:56,000
You tricked me! I avenged you!

303
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:59,000
My costar is going to be creepy!

304
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
Hop, hop, snap!

305
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
Hopoti, snap!

306
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:27,000
After all, the little girl didn't have to apologize.

307
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:31,000
But he was a little sorry.
