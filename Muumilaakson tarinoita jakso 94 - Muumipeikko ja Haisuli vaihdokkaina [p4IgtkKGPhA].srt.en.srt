1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
I'm talking mummy play.

2
00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:04,480
Red Riding Hood wouldn't be the craziest idea.

3
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:07,520
Oh, Little Red Riding Hood. What exactly do you mean?

4
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:10,560
Don't bother, wet lady. Have you forgotten?

5
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:13,640
I'm talking about mumilaaks, one of the program numbers of the party.

6
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:16,720
Oh, that's how tomorrow's suit came out.

7
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:21,200
Our best investment is a party.

8
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:24,200
Let's face it, it's tricky.

9
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:27,040
Let's face it, it's tricky.

10
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:33,040
Our best ranking is Fifth place, but this year we will win.

11
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:35,040
Certainly.

12
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:43,040
Our victory is certain. The first prize goes to us. Or what, Nipsu?

13
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:44,040
Victory is ours.

14
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:46,040
We surpass ourselves.

15
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:47,040
That's what we do.

16
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:50,040
I just have to decide who is going to wear it.

17
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:52,040
I think Little Red Riding Hood is the best.

18
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:54,040
I'm best suited as a red riding hood.

19
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:57,040
I'm the only real red riding hood.

20
00:00:57,040 --> 00:01:01,040
And you're not. I'm a red riding hood.

21
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:03,040
Do you even feel sorry for Red Riding Hood?

22
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:05,040
Of course I do.

23
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:09,040
A dire wolf attacks the same girl and eats...

24
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:13,040
No, no. Little Red Riding Hood is a good girl who kicks her glass slipper.

25
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:15,040
And then it's the cone itself that reprimands him.

26
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:17,040
And then he runs to the gingerbread house.

27
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:20,040
And then he puts his finger on the shaft.

28
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:22,040
Or something like that. And just talked.

29
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:25,040
Oh, was it really a mummy?

30
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:26,040
That...

31
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:28,040
That's why I have to be a red riding hood.

32
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:30,040
I thought I had read that fairy tale.

33
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:34,040
Sell for a moment. You made up a whole new fairy tale.

34
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:37,040
Or am I so small that a wolf can eat me?

35
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:39,040
Well, let's start with the past.

36
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:41,040
I'm a big mom then.

37
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:42,040
Who am I?

38
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:43,040
Hunter.

39
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:45,040
Hunter, e.g.

40
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:47,040
That means I'm...

41
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:49,040
Maybe it's sushi.

42
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:52,040
I don't want to play a wolf.

43
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:54,040
Moomin is a wolf.

44
00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:00,040
The dress doesn't fit me well?

45
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:02,040
Maybe it's big after all.

46
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:05,040
Better like too small.

47
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:07,040
The wolf's head is cramped for me.

48
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:09,040
Oh help, wolf.

49
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:10,040
Pum pum.

50
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:12,040
A brave scavenger shot the bad wolf.

51
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:15,040
Don't do that. You freaked me out.

52
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:18,040
Moomin Pekko Do I look like a big mom?

53
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:22,040
You are so fat that a wolf can't eat you.

54
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:25,040
That's a bummer, too. I am full.

55
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:31,040
Am I okay like this niiskunkunnie?

56
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:33,040
You don't look very scary.

57
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:37,040
The wolf should be thin and is hungry.

58
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:38,040
Absolutely.

59
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:39,040
Oh poor.

60
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:43,040
Stink, what are you doing here?

61
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:47,040
Tell us what always makes you make a fool of everyone.

62
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:49,040
Oh, what's stupid?

63
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:54,040
Let it be sold. Skunk, you can play a wolf if you want.

64
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:55,040
I don't want to be a wolf.

65
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:58,040
You will be an excellent wolf.

66
00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:00,040
Don't think so.

67
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:01,040
Do you want to be a hunter?

68
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:03,040
I'm not fit to be a hunter.

69
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:05,040
How about being a grandma?

70
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:06,040
No.

71
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:07,040
What do you want to be?

72
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:08,040
Well, the red one.

73
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:11,040
You mean you want to be a red riding hood?

74
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:14,040
Hey, didn't mean to be silly. Little Red Riding Hood is a bitch.

75
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:16,040
Oh girl?

76
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:19,040
Hey, you don't know anything about little red riding hood.

77
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:21,040
I'm just, I don't know.

78
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:24,040
Alu, look ahead.

79
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:25,040
ha Isu Li.

80
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:27,040
Catch it if you can.

81
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:29,040
Seis, Haisuli.

82
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:31,040
Stink, let's wait.

83
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:33,040
I get mad if the suit falls.

84
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:34,040
What mischief?

85
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:36,040
Back, Stinker.

86
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:37,040
Did you hear?

87
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:39,040
You imagined everything.

88
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:42,040
The squeamish chicks over there on Haisuli.

89
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:45,040
No, let's wait now.

90
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:48,040
Which way did Stingray go?

91
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:00,040
It's dark here.

92
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:02,040
What?

93
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:04,040
he i, still beautiful.

94
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:06,040
I'm a skunk.

95
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:08,040
I'm a skunk.

96
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:10,040
I'm a skunk.

97
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:12,040
I'm a skunk.

98
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:14,040
I'm a skunk.

99
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:17,040
It's dark here.

100
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:22,040
What the hell has Haisuli gone to?

101
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:28,040
Ha, there he is.

102
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:32,040
I got you.

103
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:33,040
Get loose.

104
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:34,040
And I can't.

105
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:36,040
I'll stop already.

106
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:38,040
You won't fall.

107
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:46,040
No, no, no.

108
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:49,040
No, no, no.

109
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:14,040
Help.

110
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:17,040
I'm not stupid enough to get caught.

111
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:19,040
Don't think so.

112
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:25,040
I really thought I was chasing Haisul.

113
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:27,040
Weird.

114
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:31,040
But who is running there?

115
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:33,040
Reminds me.

116
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:36,040
Am I behind myself?

117
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:38,040
Out.

118
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:49,040
I've turned into a skunk.

119
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:52,040
It probably happened when we got relegated.

120
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:55,040
And Haisuli has turned into me.

121
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:57,040
What do I do now?

122
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:05,040
Moomin doesn't follow me.

123
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:07,040
It's sad.

124
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:10,040
Moomin, what are you doing so far away?

125
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:13,040
Moomin, where is Moomin?

126
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:17,040
Don't bother joking, Moomin.

127
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:20,040
Aha, I understand there is some new play in the question.

128
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:24,040
It can't be true.

129
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:29,040
Oh no, I've turned into a Moomin.

130
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:33,040
That game can be fun if it doesn't go on too long.

131
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:36,040
You know welcome home and say hello.

132
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:41,040
What do I do? Me who was so beautiful.

133
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:44,040
Now I'm begging and short-legged.

134
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:48,040
I'm quite bald and ugly and ugly looking.

135
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:53,040
Hey, it might be useful to think I'm a Moomin.

136
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:58,040
I'm off to the Moomin house to devour Moominamma's delicious moonshine.

137
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:04,040
Moominma cooks huge amounts of food all the time.

138
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:09,040
I treat everyone badly and I'm always mistaken for Moomin.

139
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:17,040
Excuse me, but have you seen any skunks around here?

140
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:20,040
What are you talking about, you're a skunk.

141
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:23,040
No, I really am.

142
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:27,040
Start a new life and be as energetic as Moomin.

143
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:30,040
For the hundredth time, I'm not a skunk.

144
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:33,040
Aha, you have something on your mind again.

145
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:36,040
But I'm not easily tricked.

146
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:41,040
Oh shit, what do I do?

147
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:51,040
Oh Moomin, what are you doing there?

148
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:56,040
It's funny that you saved Little Red Riding Hood's costume from the skunk's eyes.

149
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:59,040
Thank you Moomin, you were brave.

150
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:01,040
Tomorrow we celebrate.

151
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:05,040
The skunk is a troublemaker, a low scoundrel and a miserable coward.

152
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:07,040
Stinky or awesome?

153
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:11,040
It's possible, but I'll beat the skunk.

154
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:15,040
That's for sure, Stink must be banished from Moominland.

155
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:18,040
I'm all for skunks just plain annoying.

156
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:21,040
Stink is the only one I really hate.

157
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:26,040
Hey, don't, me, I think Stink is nice, really.

158
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:30,040
What's wrong with you, he didn't like skunks before?

159
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:33,040
Oh yeah, I guess not.

160
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:39,040
Moomin, what's wrong with you, you're very quiet today.

161
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:42,040
Moomin did a real feat, all by himself.

162
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:46,040
He managed to grab my red hat from the skunk.

163
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:49,040
Oh well, that's good.

164
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:52,040
Moomin, you'll have half of my piece of cake.

165
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:54,040
Huh? I rarely smell.

166
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:56,040
Oh, you get my piece too.

167
00:08:56,040 --> 00:09:01,040
Really, it's fun to be so popular.

168
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:03,040
You've always been popular.

169
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:06,040
So am I.

170
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:09,040
Hey, listen, I'm there.

171
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:11,040
What?

172
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:14,040
Don't come to make villainous hooks.

173
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:16,040
Don't you ever get tired of teasing?

174
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:19,040
Hey, don't, I'm here.

175
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:21,040
Go away and don't come back.

176
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:24,040
Don't clap, you hear?

177
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:26,040
Don't you understand?

178
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:29,040
I'm me here.

179
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:31,040
How am I going to get through this?

180
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:33,040
I'm a skunk.

181
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:47,040
You've already seen the weight of the suit leg.

182
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:53,040
ha I Su Li!

183
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:55,040
Don't mess around, you're a skunk.

184
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:57,040
I am Moomin.

185
00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:02,040
You're not, you just look like a Moomin even though you're actually a skunk.

186
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:05,040
We have changed, I am the real Moomin.

187
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:07,040
Don't lie.

188
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:10,040
Moomin, what are you foaming at?

189
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:12,040
Oh sorry, I lost my temper.

190
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:15,040
Ride, Stink away like you've done before.

191
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:18,040
Yeah, hi, I'm Moomin.

192
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:20,040
Was the skunk clear?

193
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:22,040
Get out of here.

194
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:25,040
If you don't go away, I'll bite you.

195
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:28,040
You have to believe, I am Moomin.

196
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:31,040
Go away you skunk, there is no place for you here.

197
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:34,040
Hazel, say cardboard.

198
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:36,040
Don't you believe me?

199
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:43,040
Stink, I don't know what's on your mind, but this isn't funny anymore.

200
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:46,040
Dad, Don't you understand?

201
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:49,040
Ha, start blabbing about it.

202
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:52,040
Go already if your life is dear to you.

203
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:55,040
Off, as you already are.

204
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:57,040
Why don't you believe me?

205
00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:00,040
I am Moomin.

206
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:03,040
Well, well, well, let's do this.

207
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:06,040
Moomin and Stink are both allowed to stay in the Moomin house.

208
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:11,040
Over the course of the day, we'll see which one is the real Moomin. Does it fit?

209
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:13,040
Mamma, it's a fixed problem.

210
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:14,040
A problem?

211
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:18,040
There is no problem. I hate you guys.

212
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:20,040
Glad you understood at least five times.

213
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:23,040
You guys are mean.

214
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:26,040
Hihihi, what a relief.

215
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:30,040
True. Moomin mom, isn't it snack time already?

216
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:41,040
Muikkunen, snuff muikkunen.

217
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:45,040
Did you stink, do you have something to say?

218
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:48,040
Tell me, do I look like a skunk?

219
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:54,040
Your voice sounds a bit strange, but who else could you be but a skunk?

220
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:56,040
So yes.

221
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:04,040
Moomin, you lost again. What's wrong with you?

222
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:07,040
Moomin is the only one who loses.

223
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:13,040
Here I am good with patanos like a good friend.

224
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:15,040
okay?

225
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:18,040
That's exactly what I hate.

226
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:21,040
Yes, we are home again.

227
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:24,040
I don't feel embarrassed somehow.

228
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:27,040
Goblin, don't sleep. Your turn.

229
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:28,040
Card table!

230
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:31,040
I'll stop, what fun is this?

231
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:33,040
You are a rascal.

232
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:35,040
Listen, what's wrong with you?

233
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:37,040
I'm going for a walk.

234
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:39,040
In the middle of the game.

235
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:40,040
Weird.

236
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:42,040
Let's leave him alone.

237
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:47,040
My head is already spinning.

238
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:51,040
Moomins are so freaking nice and kind.

239
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:53,040
I can't stand it.

240
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:55,040
Hello, Moomin.

241
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:58,040
Is something crazy?

242
00:12:58,040 --> 00:13:00,040
It wasn't my fault.

243
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:03,040
Now tell me, what's the matter?

244
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:06,040
A burglar has broken into the Moomin house.

245
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:10,040
If you hurry, the thief can be caught in the act.

246
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:13,040
This burglar is on a criminal spree.

247
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:16,040
He might be armed. I'm already going.

248
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:21,040
Moominpappi and Moominamma, here we come.

249
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:25,040
I came out of there, hands behind my neck.

250
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:28,040
Another koura koppaa senut.

251
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:30,040
The game is played.

252
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:34,040
Come out of hiding before I get mad.

253
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:39,040
It doesn't show.

254
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:43,040
Chief of Police, what the hell are you doing here?

255
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:46,040
Moominvappa, where is the burglar hiding?

256
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:49,040
What burglar? I haven't even heard.

257
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:54,040
Moomin just said that I have to come here to arrest a burglar.

258
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:55,040
Moomin troll.

259
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:57,040
Out.

260
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:59,040
We haven't seen any burglars.

261
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:01,040
Moomin claimed otherwise.

262
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:05,040
Well, now the lily plants have been treated.

263
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:07,040
The next tribe.

264
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:12,040
Moomin, what's up?

265
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:15,040
Hello, Hemuli, what are you doing?

266
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:20,040
Here is a species of sage that is very rare everywhere.

267
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:25,040
I have been collecting these samples for 20 years and I am now putting them in order.

268
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:27,040
May I help you?

269
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:29,040
Clear.

270
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:34,040
What is the function of these dry plants?

271
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:37,040
Then the next plant, tribe.

272
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:41,040
I have never tasted a rare plant before.

273
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:44,040
Moomin, what are you doing?

274
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:47,040
It tastes bad.

275
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:49,040
Oh stop!

276
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:52,040
Moomin, what are you doing?

277
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:54,040
Moomin, what are you doing?

278
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:56,040
It tastes bad.

279
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:58,040
Oh stop!

280
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:00,040
Please, Moomin.

281
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:03,040
It's stupid to collect bad plants.

282
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:07,040
Moomin, run away!

283
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:09,040
It was fun.

284
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:12,040
Damn what he did.

285
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:16,040
My hard-earned plants.

286
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:20,040
Moomin came.

287
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:23,040
What's nice on your lap.

288
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:25,040
This is my new doll.

289
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:27,040
Give it here.

290
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:29,040
Hey, give the doll back right away.

291
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:32,040
And I won't give it, take it if you like.

292
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:39,040
Moomin, what are you doing here?

293
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:41,040
Take your doll.

294
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:46,040
That was fun, bye then.

295
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:49,040
The doll was completely destroyed.

296
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:56,040
I have told Moominma that free education is harmful.

297
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:02,040
Hi, do you eat fish well?

298
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:05,040
Hello Moomin, there will be a big catch today.

299
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:10,040
Right, good. I'll help you get an even bigger catch.

300
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:13,040
I told you so.

301
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:15,040
What's wrong with you?

302
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:17,040
Now.

303
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:34,040
Mother.

304
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:36,040
Father.

305
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:39,040
Moomin is not himself.

306
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:43,040
To put it mildly, she has become an impossible-to-grind Moomin.

307
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:48,040
I like Moomin, but some actions are unforgivable.

308
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:52,040
Unfortunately, Moomin hasn't followed law and order.

309
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:54,040
Hey, try to calm down.

310
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:56,040
That's asking too much.

311
00:16:58,040 --> 00:17:00,040
I got hungry.

312
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:02,040
What's wrong with this?

313
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:05,040
Probably equipment for tomorrow's costume party.

314
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:08,040
I guess you can get some flavor from this?

315
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:10,040
Stop, Aisuli!

316
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:12,040
Oh you Moomin!

317
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:14,040
Aisuli, don't go!

318
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:16,040
Let's go!

319
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:20,040
Here it is now seen the fruits of free cultivation.

320
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:23,040
I haven't accepted it at all.

321
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:31,040
Aisuli is still fast, even though our paws have changed.

322
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:44,040
You're not holding me!

323
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:46,040
Wait!

324
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:49,040
Oh no dead ends!

325
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:51,040
Now you're hooked!

326
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:53,040
Let me go, let me go!

327
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:55,040
You stay!

328
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:14,040
No, no, no!

329
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:17,040
No, no, no!

330
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:19,040
No, no, no!

331
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:43,040
Moomin mom, what measures are you going to take?

332
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:45,040
Pictures are needed now!

333
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:48,040
Moomin destroyed my precious collection.

334
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:50,040
What a wonder he's gone.

335
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:52,040
He used to be nicer!

336
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:55,040
Moominpapa, help Aisuli, she's babbling again!

337
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:57,040
Wait Aisuli!

338
00:18:57,040 --> 00:18:59,040
Moomin!

339
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:01,040
He chases after Aisul.

340
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:05,040
Moomin, I have something for you.

341
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:06,040
Yes dad.

342
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:08,040
For you too, Aisuli.

343
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:10,040
Oh me!

344
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:12,040
I am Aisuli.

345
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:14,040
AI Suri.

346
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:16,040
Father.

347
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:18,040
Because Moomin is there.

348
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:20,040
Because Aisuli is there.

349
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:24,040
I am my former beautiful self again.

350
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:27,040
What luck, I'm my old self again.

351
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:29,040
Lovely!

352
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:30,040
Moomin!

353
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:31,040
What father?

354
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:33,040
How could you do that to me?

355
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:36,040
And why are you playing with children's dolls?

356
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:38,040
What the hell is wrong with you Moomin?

357
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:40,040
I don't understand what I did wrong.

358
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:42,040
You must not call the police unnecessarily.

359
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:45,040
I guess it's best to run away.

360
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:50,040
Aisuli and I bumped heads together so that we switched.

361
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:51,040
Yes?

362
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:52,040
What do you mean?

363
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:55,040
Are you trying to avoid responsibility?

364
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:57,040
That explains everything.

365
00:19:57,040 --> 00:20:00,040
I knew Moomin couldn't have made those black ones.

366
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:03,040
Aisuli did naughty tricks in my character.

367
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:06,040
And you all thought I was the culprit.

368
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:08,040
Where is Aisuli anyway?

369
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:09,040
There.

370
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:12,040
Ha ha ha, bye Moomin.

371
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:16,040
I got a really delicious pie from you.

372
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:21,040
So the earlier Moomin was not Moomin.

373
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:23,040
I can't believe it.

374
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:26,040
But you are the real Moomin.

375
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:27,040
I am.

376
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:30,040
I'm Moomin, mom.

377
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:33,040
My beloved Moomin.

378
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:37,040
I have to go and complete Aisuli's criminal record.

379
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:39,040
I wish this had been known.

380
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:42,040
We believe that things are as they seem.

381
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:45,040
Moomin, how did it feel to be a changeling?

382
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:49,040
Lonely. Aisul has no friends.

383
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:53,040
Aisuli is lonely because no one likes her.

384
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:55,040
You too were lonely like Aisula.

385
00:20:55,040 --> 00:21:00,040
So you were! And now you can't run to Moominamma's arms for comfort.

386
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:07,040
Whenever I feel like it, I try to make myself turn into Moomin again.

387
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:34,040
Thanks for watching the video!
