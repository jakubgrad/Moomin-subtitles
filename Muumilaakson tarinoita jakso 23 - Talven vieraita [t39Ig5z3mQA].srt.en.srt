1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:13,000
In Moomin Valley, almost everyone sleeps through the long winter.

2
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:20,000
However, now it had happened so strangely that a small number of Moomin goblins had woken up.

3
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:29,000
I'm good! Moomin jam is needed after winter.

4
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Yes, mom is needlessly worried that you had overcooked the jam.

5
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Alas, they are still sleeping.

6
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Good thing there are two of us awake.

7
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Moomin and you don't want to try?

8
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
My heavy carcass would break the tray.

9
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Find another platform.

10
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Aren't we supposed to go see the tuttik?

11
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
I'm pulling you.

12
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
You are afraid of going down a high hill.

13
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
And not afraid either.

14
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
And not afraid.

15
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Tuutikki is not at home. Where could it be?

16
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
It can be seen coming from there.

17
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
I guess you're right.

18
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
The tuttik also slides in the snow.

19
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Does it slide?

20
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Well, at least that's how it seems to me.

21
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
He's coming this way.

22
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
where have you been

23
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Catching the sun.

24
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,000
You have to go an incredibly long way before you see it.

25
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Well, did you see the sun?

26
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Just a glimpse, but then it sank back into the horizon.

27
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Hi, what kind of fringe shoes are you wearing?

28
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Ice skates. You can move well on the ice with these.

29
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Could you show me how to use them?

30
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Of course.

31
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Great.

32
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
I'm going to make the skates myself.

33
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
I don't think you can.

34
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
About Whoops!

35
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,000
All you have to do is attach some knife-like ones to the soles of your shoes.

36
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Tuutikki, I suddenly got the feeling that we are not alone here in the swimming room.

37
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Oh, you know it.

38
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Who? Where?

39
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
There's no need to hang around, you won't see them.

40
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Or is there someone here that I don't see?

41
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Behind the kitchen table, right?

42
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:09,000
No. These are invisible, just like Ninni was.

43
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Oh oh! At the top, someone is doing the trick.

44
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:21,000
It's one of the heads. There are eight of them.

45
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Hey, don't walk on my heels.

46
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:31,000
I'm sure there were no head lice here last summer when we went swimming.

47
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
It wasn't.

48
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Of course not. There are many creatures that are not suitable for summer, spring or autumn.

49
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:45,000
But when winter comes and the days get shorter and the others have gone into hibernation, that's when they come out.

50
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:49,000
And some of them are so small that you can't even see them.

51
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:53,000
I don't understand winter at all. I don't.

52
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Of course not. You Moomin house residents have always slept through it.

53
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,000
I can't wait to tell mom and dad.

54
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Moomin-Pekko!

55
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
What?

56
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
I guess we get up in the morning?

57
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Why are you asking me?

58
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:19,000
I don't want to continue sleeping until spring.

59
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Well, we woke up today.

60
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
But we don't know about tomorrow.

61
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Of course we don't. That's why it's incredibly interesting to see what happens.

62
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,000
But wake up from me in the morning, if it does.

63
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Clear. Shall we sleep already?

64
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Moomin-Pekko, what if it happens the other way around?

65
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,000
What if I wake up and you just sleep?

66
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:47,000
I don't mind if I sleep all winter.

67
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Well, tomorrow you can sleep.

68
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Moomin-Pekko?

69
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Moomin!

70
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
where are you from

71
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Hello. You have a perfect ski hill here.

72
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:31,000
What sneakers are you wearing?

73
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Now don't be silly.

74
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Don't know what these are?

75
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
I don't! That's why I asked.

76
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,000
These are skis. These are when I went down the hill.

77
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Did I see that? Can skis also slide on ice?

78
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
On ice, skates are skis.

79
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Stick! It is used to slide in the snow.

80
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,000
It's nice going, but isn't that on a silver platter?

81
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
It's a family expense.

82
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Shall I teach you to ski?

83
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Just fine. I'm learning to ski by watching you.

84
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
I'm a skier.

85
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:19,000
For me it is. You can be sure. I don't need teaching.

86
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:30,000
So you travel. To be always by the snow?

87
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Right. Life must be a struggle. It's good jam.

88
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,000
And you can't ski then?

89
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
I'm a skier.

90
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Must be a fight. It's good jam.

91
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:47,000
So you can't fight in summer or spring?

92
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Too easy. Must be in the cold outside air.

93
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:55,000
A hardened person always stays warm.

94
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Sounds interesting.

95
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:04,000
When you poke around in the open, you get unnecessary inches.

96
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
A little poem I made up.

97
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Don't you swim in the middle of winter?

98
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Hell, I swim.

99
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Beri is deadlocked. You can't swim in it.

100
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Is there a river here?

101
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:21,000
It is, it is, but the water looks very, very cold.

102
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Excellent jam. Could you possibly have any more?

103
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Not here, but down in the basement there is. Does the cranberry sauce taste good?

104
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Well no, that's enough for now.

105
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:38,000
But it might taste good after a swim.

106
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Hop!

107
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,000
I get chills even watching it.

108
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Is everyone around you like that?

109
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:58,000
No, unfortunately. Come too.

110
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
No, thanks.

111
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,000
What are you watching?

112
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Hey, we're looking at that crazy guy who's traveling in the river.

113
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Swim in winter, there are strange people here in Moomin Valley.

114
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Yeah, but he's not from here. where are you from

115
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:30,000
My name is Surku and I have come here to look for my brothers.

116
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Or your brothers? Are your brothers hibernating?

117
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:39,000
No, my brothers don't hibernate.

118
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:49,000
In Moomin Valley, everyone else hibernates, except the little one, the little one, the invisible heads, me and that swim.

119
00:08:49,000 --> 00:09:00,000
My brothers are in the lonely mountains.

120
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Oh, up there?

121
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Curious thing. I have thought that wolves live there, not dogs.

122
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Wolves are brothers of dogs.

123
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Thus. After sleep, the jam even tastes tastier.

124
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,000
I also really like strawberry jam.

125
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
A very young man.

126
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Hauveli, Don't you eat your jam?

127
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,000
I don't. You just eat.

128
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:34,000
With pleasure. You seem to be worried about something.

129
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
I guess I am.

130
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,000
It won't do you any good. Don't think about unpleasant things.

131
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:45,000
What makes you think wolves are your brothers?

132
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:50,000
They are. Everyone knows that. And I feel a wolf in me.

133
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:54,000
You can feel it, but I assure you no one can see it.

134
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:59,000
I want to go to the wolves and howl at the moon.

135
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:05,000
I can see why he thinks he's a wolf, but we better keep him here.

136
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,000
You can't join wolves.

137
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Yes, I want to.

138
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:16,000
You could go traveling with me, I like small dogs.

139
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
I don't know.

140
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:22,000
We will become good friends. I'm staying here in Moomin Valley for a while.

141
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Will you stay with us?

142
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:29,000
I'll stay. The slopes are great and the jam is excellent. Oh, I have to build myself an igloo.

143
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Oh, a snow hut like that?

144
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:38,000
So. Delicious. If it's okay with you, I'll take some of this jam with me.

145
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Can I borrow your shovel for a moment?

146
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
You can, but what do you need it for?

147
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
I'm going to break the barrel.

148
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Well, that's easy.

149
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Is it okay?

150
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
I am.

151
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
I am.

152
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
I am.

153
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
I am.

154
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
I am.

155
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Is it okay?

156
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Our Hemuli guest is an absolutely impossible jam mouth.

157
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:23,000
It is. And not the peace it blessed since he came.

158
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Tuutikki, Can you ski?

159
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Of course. Now I just haven't had time.

160
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Hemuli is going to teach me to ski.

161
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:37,000
I can't move my legs when they are tied.

162
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Of course, that's the joke, move the skis.

163
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
The skis fly away.

164
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:50,000
So, first you learn to fall.

165
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,000
If I learned to ski, I wouldn't fall.

166
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
The sale has also received skis.

167
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,000
The hood is made of barrel boards.

168
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Your successes will be much better.

169
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Bend your knees and let's continue.

170
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,000
This slope is too steep for me.

171
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
I want a smaller hill.

172
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Next time then. Now let's go.

173
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Trying to cause an avalanche?

174
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,000
This slope is even steeper than the previous one.

175
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:25,000
No don't, mourn. You already know how to fall perfectly.

176
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
You have to!

177
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Speak up, you have to!

178
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
You have to!

179
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Now they are dancing!

180
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Don't go, talk, go!

181
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Don't go!

182
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Don't go!

183
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Please stop me. Just throw yourself on your ass.

184
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:54,000
It's going great. Smooth and original.

185
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Hi, please.

186
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Hi, please.

187
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Hi, please.

188
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Hi, please.

189
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Hey, please stop me.

190
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Hey, please stop me.

191
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Very nice mummy again.

192
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Alas, why are you dancing in the window?

193
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
My brothers howl in the mountains.

194
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:32,000
They must be hungry for wolves.

195
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,000
They call me over.

196
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,280
I have decided to go and greet them.

197
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:53,480
A twitch?

198
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:55,000
Win?

199
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:59,200
We're in trouble. The jam is running out.

200
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:00,800
Because of the hemulin?

201
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:03,000
M-m, he's gobbling up jam.

202
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,200
Tell him to go away.

203
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:06,600
A quick one.

204
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:10,000
It's aggravating. Everything has its limits.

205
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Ai!

206
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:23,000
Lumimyrsk.

207
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:27,000
It might mean that spring is not far away.

208
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Good morning.

209
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Good morning. The jam has already run out.

210
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
The bottom is shining.

211
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
It was a delicious jam.

212
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:17,000
It doesn't hurt at all, even if it ends once.

213
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
The bottom is shining.

214
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
The bottom is shining.

215
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
The bottom is shining.

216
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
The bottom is shining.

217
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
The bottom is shining.

218
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
The bottom is shining.

219
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
The bottom is shining.

220
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:37,000
It doesn't matter at all, even though it's over, spring has started and I'm going on my way.

221
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Are you leaving?

222
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:46,000
I'm leaving. Maybe the mother will hatch more jam next summer.

223
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Farewell and good health.

224
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,000
It's fun that we became friends.

225
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
Are you leaving?

226
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:24,200
I am Surku, your brother.

227
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:29,000
I have wanted to come to you for a long, long time.

228
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:40,000
I'm not very strong or brave, but I could be with you.

229
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:54,000
I guess I was mistaken. Then eat me. What's up with that?

230
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:42,000
Little Hauveli, Is this where you sit? Have you been waiting for me long?

231
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:48,000
We will have fun when we travel together.

232
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:38,000
Sell!

233
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:50,000
It's spring cannon fire. I watch the sea rush towards us.

234
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:55,000
Will Myy get back?

235
00:18:55,000 --> 00:19:13,000
My hardware!

236
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:17,000
Sell! Jump on the back!

237
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:26,000
Thank you Myy!

238
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:34,000
It swims well Sell, don't waste it on people!

239
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:39,000
Sell defectors there!

240
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:45,000
Do you notice Myy? There's nothing wrong with doing as I say!

241
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:52,000
Not so! I won't save you a second time!

242
00:19:52,000 --> 00:20:02,000
Moomin, you can do it! A little more!

243
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
Hey baby!

244
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,000
It's so cold here!

245
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:14,000
Grab my paw. Let's light the white immediately.

246
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:21,000
Ush!
