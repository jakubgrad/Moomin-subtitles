1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,000
It had been raining in Moomin Valley for a week and a half.

2
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Moomin had done everything that can be done inside.

3
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Now he was engrossed in reading romantic stories.

4
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Me here. May I come?

5
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Moomin, suppose you are there.

6
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Why didn't you answer?

7
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Oh yeah, Miss Strike.

8
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
What's wrong with you?

9
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
No.

10
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Does the rain get you down?

11
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Not at all. The rain is nice.

12
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
It won't last weeks with these.

13
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Has it lasted?

14
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,000
You haven't come to see me. It's so boring in the rain.

15
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Not about me.

16
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
It's a lie.

17
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I have read.

18
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
All these books.

19
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Yeah, I borrowed from mymmell.

20
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Contemporary stories.

21
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Wildly romantic.

22
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Cheap entertainment.

23
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
It works for me. All those gorgeous heroines.

24
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Katinkonti.

25
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Pretentious chickens.

26
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Don't you appreciate me?

27
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Huh!

28
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,000
I dragged myself to you in the rain because I thought you needed a follower.

29
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
But you don't notice me.

30
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Sorry, hit lady, but the heroines of these stories completely draw me into their world.

31
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
I'm going home.

32
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Huh!

33
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:47,000
You keep dreaming about silly heroines.

34
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Why was Niiskuneiti angry?

35
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Goodbye! I'm leaving now.

36
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Well, you just came.

37
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
I don't want to disturb the Moomin.

38
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Or disturb?

39
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Oh shoemaker! Disaster!

40
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Dude, what now?

41
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Something horrible, right?

42
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Yes, the whole circus has been swept away by the flood current.

43
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
What?

44
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
The Moomin house gets flooded again.

45
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Do you know how the circus people have been?

46
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
How would I know?

47
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
They can seek shelter in this vicinity.

48
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
What are you imagining?

49
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Do you know the attraction of the circus?

50
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
I know, that long-nosed prima donna.

51
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
They say she is very beautiful.

52
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
The current has carried him away.

53
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:41,000
If a prima donna swims in these corners I could save her.

54
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
I would be his hero.

55
00:02:47,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Hey, you're waiting!

56
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
I will save you.

57
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
I'm Moomin, from this neighborhood.

58
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
And you are a lovely Primadonna.

59
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000
I am wonderful, I can admit that.

60
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,000
But I am the Primadonna's steed.

61
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Oh, where is Primadonna?

62
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,000
The road collapsed as the flood rushed over us.

63
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,000
I would be happy with the crackle of a campfire and brushing.

64
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
The Moomin is coming back.

65
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Hi, where have you been?

66
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Primadonna has sought shelter nearby.

67
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
This is his horse.

68
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Come in.

69
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Thanks.

70
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
I guess he's not kicking.

71
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Father, here is the Primadonna's horse.

72
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
This is a great honor for us.

73
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Please get better.

74
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Moomin, what are you doing?

75
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
I will find the Primadonna and save her.

76
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Prima donnas don't know how to take care of themselves.

77
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Speak up.

78
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Someone is smiling.

79
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Speak up.

80
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
You must be a Primadonna.

81
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,000
I knew someone was coming to save me.

82
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Did you know that I will help you out of trouble?

83
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:06,000
I didn't know it was you, but the Primadonna can count on that,

84
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,000
that some eager young man always saves her.

85
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Speak up.

86
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
This is where I live.

87
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Welcome back, Moomin.

88
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Hi niiskunmi, I think I found Primadonna.

89
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Here's my hand.

90
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Thank you young man.

91
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Too bad we can't eat in the dining room.

92
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Fortunately, we are able to prepare breakfast without a kitchen.

93
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Yes, when we have a stove, dry firewood and fresh bread.

94
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Oh good time, I took the coffee beans, but forgot the coffee grinder and the pan.

95
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:06,000
It's okay, nobody wants coffee.

96
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:13,000
And whoever wants can chew coffee beans and wash them down with hot water.

97
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Where are you going?

98
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
To wake up the Primadonna.

99
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:21,000
He can come to the breakfast table with us.

100
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Moomin!

101
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Prima donna! Prima donna!

102
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
In!

103
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Good morning young man.

104
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Good morning, breakfast is waiting.

105
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Thank you, I start the day by drinking a cup of coffee in bed.

106
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Coffee?

107
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:47,000
I can't imagine getting up until I've had a cup of mocha.

108
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Dad, isn't the kitchen directly below?

109
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Yes, yes, but what is not to do.

110
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,000
I don't understand this fuss.

111
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
The saw has an opening.

112
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Oh, for what.

113
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:14,000
I have to get to the kitchen this red minute.

114
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Don't fool around.

115
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,000
I got a coffee grinder and a pan from the kitchen.

116
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Good morning.

117
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Isn't the coffee ready yet?

118
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
This won't last more than a moment.

119
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Mom, boil the water.

120
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Your kitchen is a bit watery at the moment.

121
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Don't you have flowers?

122
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,000
I don't eat anything else.

123
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Primadonna has wrapped Moomin around her little finger.

124
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Prima donna?

125
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Primadonna has wrapped Moomin around her little finger.

126
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:03,000
A prima donna does that for young men to be chosen.

127
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,000
I see you eat all the flowers.

128
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,000
I never want to see them again.

129
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Why don't you?

130
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Well, Moomin has carved into the frame.

131
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Well, the writing is now under water.

132
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
The flowers are dedicated to Niiskunneid.

133
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Eat the flowers, it's right for that creature.

134
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:31,000
I can't take it, and I feel like eating the tree bare.

135
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Rauskuta, I'll scratch the writing off when the water has receded.

136
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Here is the tree I told you about.

137
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Beautiful flowers.

138
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,000
That woman is in Moomin's bag again.

139
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Take my hand.

140
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Whoops, the tree hums.

141
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,000
The roots have loosened from the flood.

142
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,000
The Moomin's screws have come loose.

143
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
What smell?

144
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Young man, please help me up a little.

145
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Joy of the mind.

146
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Grab a paw and trust me.

147
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
But do you have enough power?

148
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
On, on.

149
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Moomin retale.

150
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Is this normal?

151
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Let's shake the lady down.

152
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Flea is good for both.

153
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Do not release the grip.

154
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Moomin troll.

155
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Moomin, help me too.

156
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Miss Strike, how are you here?

157
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Give me a zero too, Kelmi.

158
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Don't even talk to me.

159
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
What's gnawing at you?

160
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,000
He may be a jealous young man.

161
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Jealous of whom?

162
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Oh, I'm a strongman.

163
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Good, good, more.

164
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
More, more, more, more.

165
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Good show.

166
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Now be careful.

167
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
I haven't been here before.

168
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Where are we?

169
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
At the foot of the lonely mountains.

170
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,000
We have to wait until the water recedes.

171
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Look, there's a moose and a mymmeli.

172
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Hi, Moomin, Snow Maiden.

173
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Hey, oh they're here too.

174
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Strongman.

175
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Primadonna.

176
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Do you know Primadonna?

177
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,000
We are from the same circus.

178
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Why did he have to come here?

179
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
I thought I would have been able to enjoy a moment of peace.

180
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
What the hell happened to him?

181
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
I remembered a literary thing.

182
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:55,000
If Primadonna asks me, tell me I don't know where I'm going and when I'll be back, if I do.

183
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Goodbye.

184
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Strange man.

185
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Who was that? Stands well in hand.

186
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
So it stood.

187
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Please, are you amused by the strongman's flat presentation?

188
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Where did he go?

189
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Not rare.

190
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Not even a hint.

191
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Lovely.

192
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:21,000
He went to get special treats for my lunch.

193
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Discernment is good for him.

194
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,000
He didn't promise to come back soon.

195
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Understandably, it's hard to find food that satisfies my taste buds.

196
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Moomin troll.

197
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
What?

198
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Make me old Entertain me while the strongman gets me something to eat.

199
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
I don't think I can.

200
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:46,000
You can't be so stupid.

201
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Moomin, try standing on it.

202
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:53,000
How could I entertain you?

203
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Scoundrel.

204
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,000
That's your headache young man.

205
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Yes, but...

206
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,000
It's your fault I'm here.

207
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Your stupid valley flooded and you brought me here.

208
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,000
This is where you organize these things.

209
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Moomin, try standing on it.

210
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Go you hippies.

211
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Walk to the edge of the world so that you fall down too.

212
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:23,000
I feel like I don't understand women.

213
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:30,000
I feel that Moomin has a lot to learn about women.

214
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:34,000
I have a nasty feeling that Primadonna is selfish.

215
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:40,000
How can someone be so beautiful without being nice?

216
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:44,000
I hate women, I do!

217
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
I couldn't have said it better.

218
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
You are the strong man.

219
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
You've obviously met Primadonna.

220
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:55,000
The prima donna imagines that you are getting her food.

221
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Ha ha!

222
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Couldn't you go back to Primadonna?

223
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,000
He won't make it when I left too.

224
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Ha ha, young man, Prima donnas are never alone.

225
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
You will find someone.

226
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Thank you for taking care of him.

227
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Now he can fend for himself for a while.

228
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Will anything come of it?

229
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:24,000
What if he suddenly wants to drink a cup of Javanese mocha?

230
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
You can do without.

231
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
She's a prima donna.

232
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Let it be Primadonna for me, this boy has had enough.

233
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:36,000
But he is so sweet when his big soft eyes fill with tears.

234
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,000
I know, she always has a piece of onion in her handbag.

235
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:43,000
I'm going elsewhere, I'm starting my own circus.

236
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Ah, there comes a horse.

237
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Aha, that's where the strongman is.

238
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
I've been looking for you everywhere.

239
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
What matter?

240
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:01,000
Primadonna told me to say that as soon as you've ordered lunch, you can start planning a new number.

241
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:04,000
He is tired of the old one.

242
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
And should I cook first?

243
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Eat half first.

244
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Tell Primadonna that there will be no new numbers, and no lunch, nothing.

245
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:18,000
I thought you'd say that.

246
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Hey, you didn't want anything from a teenager, didn't you?

247
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:28,000
No, a delicious meal is now closest to Primadonna's tormented heart.

248
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Hoho, you can wait for nothing, I would have tried to make you his running boy.

249
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
I don't think so.

250
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
I don't think so.

251
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Did the strongman really say that?

252
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Yes he said.

253
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:57,000
He has done too much standing on top. Men are so weak.

254
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Hey, it looks like you're already slipping from yours.

255
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:08,000
It doesn't bother me if you don't want a roof over it, but a thunderstorm is coming.

256
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,000
I have to get between the sheets.

257
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:14,000
There are no beds in sight.

258
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:19,000
If we help in the construction, then we don't have to stay in the sky.

259
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Oh, what a charming lodge!

260
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Yes, you are clever builders and there is plenty of space.

261
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:31,000
We all go to sleep comfortably.

262
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:35,000
There will be water soon. How are their resses going?

263
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:38,000
They know how to get wet.

264
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
What don't you?

265
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:12,000
Oltan proceeded.

266
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,000
For example, batch management is awesome.

267
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Lu weatherman foundation!

268
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Under the light of the sun!

269
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Under the light of the sun!

270
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Aarua, luovres...

271
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:30,000
For the love of this earth,

272
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Painuka arrested!

273
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Go to the store if your own skin is a goat for you!

274
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,000
Help! Help!

275
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:56,000
I'm going to run. I worry about others.

276
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
What are they?

277
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Hats. Harmless but terribly electric in thunder.

278
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Arousing terror.

279
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,000
I'm used to them.

280
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,000
There!

281
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
You are not needed here!

282
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Hattivats have surrounded them.

283
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Fuck it!

284
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:22,000
They don't seem to have any problems. There was no need to run the whole way.

285
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Oh, how's it going!

286
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Very! Your prima donna is missing.

287
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Hattivati might have promised to make him coffee.

288
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Prima donna!

289
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
Prima donna!

290
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
Prima donna!

291
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Prima donna!

292
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
The prima donna is here.

293
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
I'm running!

294
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Up at the top.

295
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:52,000
What is he doing there among the branches?

296
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,000
Volo, he's scared to death of hatties.

297
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
Hoi, Primadonna!

298
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,000
No, he doesn't want to answer.

299
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:05,000
He is struck dumb with terror. I have to help him down.

300
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:08,000
Listen boy, it's my job.

301
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,000
I'm the strong man.

302
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,000
Strongman, be kind to him.

303
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Clear.

304
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,000
I wish I could climb like a monkey.

305
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Is Primadonna all right?

306
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
The prima donna is angry.

307
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,000
She waited all evening in vain for her strongman.

308
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:38,000
Forgive me, Hempukka.

309
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:44,000
Grab your strongman by the neck and you'll be down in no time.

310
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:48,000
Primadonna is a little strongman.

311
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:53,000
From now on, the prima donna is on a sweet head.

312
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
Always cordial.

313
00:18:55,000 --> 00:19:00,000
That's good. The strongman has been very angry.

314
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Aha, now they come.

315
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:08,000
Hey, strongman, look.

316
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
What?

317
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:12,000
Isn't there a tent stuck to that rock?

318
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
Oh, ah, a tent.

319
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:17,000
Oh, it's a circus tent.

320
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
Goodbye.

321
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Goodbye.

322
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,000
Goodbye.

323
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
Goodbye.

324
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:30,000
Come and see the strong man's new issue.

325
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
Don't you get tired?

326
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,000
Not a bit.

327
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:37,000
Sure can sit on your shoulders?

328
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
You never tire me.

329
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,000
Miss Niisku looks happy.

330
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:47,000
Moomin-Pekko does have to do a bit of bragging to light up Miss Niisku's heart again.

331
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
Or what, Moomin-Pekko?

332
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
Were you talking about me?

333
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
We said you're awfully strong.

334
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:57,000
Moomin-Pekko can carry me all the way to the Moomin house.

335
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:00,000
Well, of course I carry him sometimes.

336
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:05,000
Do not! Moomin-Pakko manly pride won't allow that, will Moomin-Pakko?

337
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
Of course not.

338
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:11,000
You impress us, Moomin Pekko?

339
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:15,000
Especially when the Moomin House is still an hour away.

340
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
One hour trip?

341
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:22,000
Moomin-Pekko carried Miss Niisku all the way.

342
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:26,000
And decided that he would never be a prima donna again.
