1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Good morning, skunk, good morning!

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Who are you?

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
What are you doing here?

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Look!

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
What have you done to grandma papa?

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Are you the best?

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Me me?

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Am I a thief?

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
There's no point trying to fool us!

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Oops!

11
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
What is your name?

12
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
It is...

13
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Mikku Matta, I know what you're going to do!

14
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Pinch movement in the joints!

15
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Oh granny troll here!

16
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Granny troll here!

17
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
The best burglar has knocked out grandma!

18
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Granny Goblin!

19
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
What's the fuss here so early?

20
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Come down!

21
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Grandma Papa needs help urgently!

22
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
The best burglar came in and knocked out granny.

23
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Knocked out?

24
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Oh, I don't!

25
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Granny troll, don't chase!

26
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Run now to get the police master!

27
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Tell me there's a criminal lurking here!

28
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
But he is...

29
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Granny, don't take it too hard.

30
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Maybe papa isn't feeling bad now.

31
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Hello granny troll!

32
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Granny Goblin!

33
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Granny, what's the matter?

34
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Sell the mug!

35
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Don't try to block me!

36
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
This scoundrel hit on grandma's skills!

37
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Oh, mummipapa!

38
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
What has happened here?

39
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Tell Sell!

40
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
No?

41
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Mummipapa!

42
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Didn't grandma papa get knocked out?

43
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
From whom?

44
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
From Murtoparka, from there!

45
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
No?

46
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
What?

47
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Isn't it the best?

48
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
It isn't!

49
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
So who is it?

50
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Dad's old friend. His name is Hömölö.

51
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Just like that.

52
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,000
He came unexpectedly to see me last night.

53
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Ahem, a bit embarrassing!

54
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Why didn't anyone tell me?

55
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Hey hey, nice to meet you!

56
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
I think it's a lot of fun too.

57
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
My name is Hömölö.

58
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Hey.

59
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Now this was funny.

60
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
You thought Hömölö was a burglar.

61
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,000
I was not given a chance to explain.

62
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Do I look like a burglar?

63
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
We apologize.

64
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
You are so hasty.

65
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:40,000
I thought papa was knocked out when I saw him lying on his knees in the ditch.

66
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Good thief's face, gets permission to bear the consequences.

67
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Brave girl!

68
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:51,000
We haven't met in ages and we talked until the morning.

69
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
We slept downstairs.

70
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,000
And I thought a burglar had crept in at night.

71
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
That decorative plate on the edge of the fireplace is beautiful.

72
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
I was looking into it.

73
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Crazy thing.

74
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
A false alarm of Kuosisauda!

75
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Always sell conclusions.

76
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Gag!

77
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
We laugh here.

78
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Anna cakes!

79
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Goof, you can stay with us as long as you want.

80
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,000
It's been an incredibly long time since we last saw you.

81
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Thank you very much.

82
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:32,000
I think it would be fun to know how long Moominpappa and Hömölö have been friends.

83
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,000
We have known each other since we were growing up.

84
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
We were schoolmates.

85
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Oh, Juku!

86
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
I changed majors at a fast pace during my school years.

87
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,000
As I recall, we met in the last grade.

88
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Was it that stupid?

89
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Up.

90
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Moominpapa and I got on well.

91
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,000
It's fun that you were able to see each other again.

92
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Oh, I forgot.

93
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
I have a little gift for you all.

94
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Number?

95
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Oh for us.

96
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Oh.

97
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
What's in it?

98
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Oh, I always like gifts.

99
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Open it up.

100
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
All right, I can open.

101
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
That's a nice man.

102
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
I thought as soon as I saw the goof.

103
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
No.

104
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Shall I open?

105
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Open, open.

106
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
What was it?

107
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
It was a gift.

108
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
And poh, I say.

109
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
They gave me goosebumps.

110
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,000
You haven't changed a bit.

111
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Don't give a shit about me.

112
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Someone was known to be sick.

113
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Could have had a heart attack.

114
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Oh, I was already taken by heart.

115
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
None of you look old and sick.

116
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
It's a beast for us to make jokes.

117
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:57,000
The teachers were always in his line of fire.

118
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Oh, what the hell was he doing?

119
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Well, he hung a water jug above the classroom door.

120
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Or put frogs on the cathedral.

121
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Frogs?

122
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
You were as chubby as I was.

123
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Dad, did you make koltos too?

124
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Papa, I guess not.

125
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Me? Of course not.

126
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Hömelön was joking.

127
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
haven't you told

128
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,000
how did you hide the Rotten Egg in the teacher's room

129
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
and it was never found?

130
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Did I include one?

131
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,000
I never thought fathers were like that.

132
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Fathers wear a hat and look dignified.

133
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Hats don't always make you look more dignified.

134
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
What do you mean?

135
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:48,000
It's just that hats might not be your style.

136
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Shut up! I know what you were trying to say.

137
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:56,000
You can wear a hat on yourself because of the stupid ears.

138
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
I don't, don't bother.

139
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Those were good times in those teenage years.

140
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
We had a great time.

141
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Listen Hömölö, would you like to go back to the past?

142
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Well, that's where I'm heading right now.

143
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Father...

144
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
All right, right now.

145
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Let's go.

146
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Our course.

147
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,000
I will never learn to understand adults.

148
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Why do you guys have such a big jump?

149
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Gotta make sure while the iron is hot.

150
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Properly.

151
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Take care of yourselves.

152
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Yes, please.

153
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Bye.

154
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Bye, Dad.

155
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Reminiscing about their school days makes them complete jerks.

156
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Are moving.

157
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Oh well.

158
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,000
I know the place.

159
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:55,000
It is very difficult for me to imagine my father as a small child.

160
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
He must have been rasaville.

161
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Hey, I made it up.

162
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Oh what?

163
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
It's going to be a tough one.

164
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Istemukaa.

165
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Let's go after them and convince them.

166
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Why?

167
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,000
I am curious to know what they did as children.

168
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Sounds fun.

169
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Let's go.

170
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
I hardly recognize the father.

171
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
They think they are little boys.

172
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Are moving.

173
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,000
They have no idea that we are following them.

174
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Yes.

175
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Behind that pimple is the school...

176
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Yeah, that's where the old thesis can be seen.

177
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Well, we have to take a look there.

178
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Oh.

179
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,000
The building has not changed at all since our school years.

180
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Is there still the same principal there?

181
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
It would be fun to meet.

182
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Our former school.

183
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Same rusty gate.

184
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Everything is unchanged.

185
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,000
And it's three minutes behind the clock.

186
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Nice to be here again.

187
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Hey looker.

188
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
We still have our secret passage.

189
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Nope.

190
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
That's it.

191
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Oh, unusual.

192
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:25,000
From here we got out and sneaked back.

193
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:29,000
And the headmaster roared at us with a red face when he had found us.

194
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Do I sneak in like the good old days?

195
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Inspiration. Go ahead of you.

196
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
So what's that?

197
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Hey, could you have a little smoke?

198
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Clear.

199
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,000
I got stuck in my stomach.

200
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:51,000
It doesn't work as easily as before.

201
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,000
I feel that the corridor has become more cramped.

202
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Or maybe. The corridor is unchanged and we have become thicker.

203
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Probably.

204
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Oh, you looked at that.

205
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Oops, our tree brand.

206
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Yeah, we carved them into that frame.

207
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,000
When we got out of school.

208
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,000
And as we carved, we forged an eternal friendship.

209
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
It's a wonder they survived.

210
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:22,000
I remember that we climbed a tree and got a good kick out of it.

211
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
There they are. What can you do?

212
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Flashing wood.

213
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
And now they are climbing it.

214
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,000
I used to climb a tree while playing.

215
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
They're total brats.

216
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:38,000
And way too old to do tree climbing.

217
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Someone will come.

218
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
How to survive? A joke.

219
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Hazel hen!

220
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
We got up.

221
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
The view is the same as then.

222
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Just like in the old days.

223
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
This is something.

224
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:06,000
While we were happy here, the principal used to be cruel.

225
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Hey, are you rascals from school again?

226
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Do you remember?

227
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:15,000
I remember. I can still hear his voice in my ears.

228
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Hey, are you rascals from school again?

229
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
I can hear it too.

230
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Doesn't the word work?

231
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Right off the tree.

232
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Come on, Headmaster, we just...

233
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
When we had to do that...

234
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
I don't listen to any explanations.

235
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,000
As punishment, you get to clean the whole school.

236
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:45,000
I will personally check the final result.

237
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,000
But, Headmaster, it's good if we don't...

238
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
No complaints.

239
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Start cleaning immediately.

240
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Yes, but...

241
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Let's give it a try.

242
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Bad luck.

243
00:10:55,000 --> 00:11:00,000
I see. The principal believes that we are still his students.

244
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Can't hear the word or doesn't it work?

245
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,000
While you're cleaning, pamper yourself.

246
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Do not climb the tree.

247
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Come on, roll up your sleeves.

248
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Excuse me now, Headmaster, but when we really don't...

249
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Well, now what?

250
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Well, since we haven't been students at this school for years.

251
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:29,000
We just came here to compare old school memories.

252
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Absolutely.

253
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,000
I guess you'll notice his mustache too.

254
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Well, a mustache.

255
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Funny looking mustache.

256
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:42,000
They probably belong in tonight's fancy dress.

257
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Fancy dress? Oh, the annual star party.

258
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
And it is now today.

259
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:53,000
You have successful masquerades, but it is not related to cleaning.

260
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Every corner clean.

261
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:00,000
The father and the fool are in a real bind.

262
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
It's just right for them.

263
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
What is the star party like?

264
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:08,000
There are sure to be goodies on offer.

265
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Hey kids, why don't you come help us?

266
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
How did you find us?

267
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
We were careless.

268
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Did you know we shadowed you?

269
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
I don't know you.

270
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Sorry Headmaster, of course you don't. May I introduce?

271
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:28,000
I do know. You're his little brother, aren't you?

272
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Kid brother?

273
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
And you are clearly his sister.

274
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
I'm not.

275
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,000
You are a cousin and this thumb pot is a little cousin.

276
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,000
And I won't be barked at as a thumbs-up.

277
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Welcome to school. I will show you the classes and introduce you to the students.

278
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Like real.

279
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Can we participate in the star party?

280
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Of course.

281
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Hiihaa.

282
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Lovely.

283
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Principal, listen.

284
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,000
The two of you will clean up first.

285
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Follow me.

286
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Hey then dad.

287
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
See you soon.

288
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Be diligent.

289
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Just celebrate, just celebrate.

290
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Oh, anyway.

291
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:10,000
The headmaster still only sees us as little schoolboys.

292
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
So it seems.

293
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Maybe we'll let him stick to that belief.

294
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Masquerade costumes are stored here. You are free to choose the outfit.

295
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Let's see what we can find.

296
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,000
I want to be a star princess.

297
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
A bow gun.

298
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
I chose something to wear.

299
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
I already took mine.

300
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Hi, I saw a dress.

301
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Can't find anything suitable here.

302
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
A pinch, look.

303
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
No.

304
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Well, how does it look?

305
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Sell, don't scare me.

306
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
You look like a wizard.

307
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Am I becoming a witch?

308
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Hi, are you new?

309
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
I haven't seen you here before.

310
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Hey, we're new.

311
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
who are you

312
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
I am Vertti.

313
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:06,000
All yellow beaks must always show themselves to me first.

314
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Oh yeah, you run the school.

315
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Did you guess right?

316
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Itiks have no right to speak here.

317
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Don't joke, I can shout you out of here.

318
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
You don't.

319
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
I can.

320
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Vert.

321
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Good day principal.

322
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
It rained perfectly.

323
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
I will introduce them to others later.

324
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
They are new.

325
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Stay in tune.

326
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Let's try.

327
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
You don't.

328
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:36,000
I have to start preparing my suit too.

329
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Ha, does the headmaster participate in the masquerade too?

330
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Of course.

331
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:44,000
I appear every year in the costume of the star bearer.

332
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Unusual.

333
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
At least from Kullunkuri.

334
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Vertti, take good care of them.

335
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Yes, Headmaster.

336
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
What now?

337
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
This is the principal's office.

338
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Let's explore places every chance we get.

339
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
We have to follow the traditions.

340
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Right.

341
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Exactly.

342
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
You are quiet and focused.

343
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Give you some cream from behind.

344
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Good work.

345
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Hello, Saki manager.

346
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Nice job.

347
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Who are you?

348
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
The students of this school, of course.

349
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Up, up.

350
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:34,000
The students don't have mustaches or top hats.

351
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:40,000
As an older student, I gave enough advice that that joke is outdated.

352
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,000
True.

353
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Don't imagine that the headmaster will fail.

354
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
What the hell is this talking about?

355
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,000
This is a cat, isn't it?

356
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:53,000
We used to do the same thing.

357
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:56,000
And once the headmaster really lost his mind.

358
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Who are you?

359
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Saki leaders.

360
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Same as you.

361
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Hey, let's make the headmaster the biggest prank of all time tonight.

362
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:10,000
That's an impossibly great idea.

363
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:13,000
I don't know how good you were back then.

364
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:17,000
But I can assure you that nowadays no one comes up with tricks as clever as me.

365
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Wow, you seem very confident.

366
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
All right.

367
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
Let's see who comes up with a better trick.

368
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Are we competing?

369
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Yay, I'm getting excited.

370
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,000
It's not easy to fool the principal.

371
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:35,000
We have our pride, we must win.

372
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
Must win.

373
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Could you find a better suit?

374
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:48,000
There could be something fun here.

375
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Aha, interesting header.

376
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Would that fit?

377
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
At least it feels warm.

378
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
We must hurry now.

379
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,000
A bunch of beautiful hats suits you.

380
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
So do I.

381
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:08,000
It looks more like a cleaning mop.

382
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
I think the principal is coming.

383
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:18,000
Fire scares Kat and Piansseo in a panic.

384
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Did you wear a funny outfit?

385
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Hey, wrong hat.

386
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Well, it's time once again to start our annual star party.

387
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Oh what!

388
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:34,000
I have a lovely outfit, thank you.

389
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
I feel a piece of cart.

390
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:44,000
It's a cat, what the hell.

391
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
Nipsu, what's wrong with you?

392
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Oh, oh, oh, I don't know.

393
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
How's that roof over there?

394
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,000
Whoah whoah, I finally went.

395
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
I don't see anything.

396
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
Help, help.

397
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,000
Hi unusual.

398
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
Pinch, did you get hurt?

399
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
You are so stupid.

400
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Now we start the main event of our star party and light the campfire.

401
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
It's now a menu.

402
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
On.

403
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
The time was up.

404
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:27,000
Oops, what's next? Has the ring gotten wet?

405
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
We succeeded.

406
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
Right timing too.

407
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
Fireworks.

408
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
How beautiful.

409
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,000
We did it.

410
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,000
Reserve better in the old one.

411
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
We are unbeatable.

412
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,000
Dad went crazy.

413
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
Oh, now what?

414
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,000
The principal passed out.

415
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,000
Hi-hi.

416
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
Although the headmaster badly.

417
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
The headmaster does not regain consciousness.

418
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
What's the trouble?

419
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
Too big a guess, I think.

420
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
Principal, please open your eyes.

421
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
Oh, how terrible.

422
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
The reason for the corpse papa and hemelo.

423
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
Dad, what are we going to do?

424
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
The principal is now taking it easy.

425
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
I forgot that he has become old.

426
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
Had my heart failed me?

427
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Headmaster.

428
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
I have gone.

429
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:21,000
Could you do me one last favor?

430
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Headmaster Kulta.

431
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
What do you wish for?

432
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
We'll do anything.

433
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:31,000
I have a special drawing on a shelf in my office.

434
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
Oh, the drawing.

435
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:37,000
I would like to see it one more time before I die.

436
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
Principal, don't die yet.

437
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
So the drawing is on the shelf.

438
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
That's how it was.

439
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
I'll go get it.

440
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
Try to hurry.

441
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
Where is it?

442
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
Is it this?

443
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
I found.

444
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
I found it, this is it.

445
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
Because the other one too.

446
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
What a terrible scratch.

447
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
This reminds me of something.

448
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
Now I remember.

449
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
We drew these pictures of the principal.

450
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
Do you like these?

451
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
Headmaster.

452
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
I guess I got string products.

453
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
How so?

454
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
And you weren't on the grain the whole time?

455
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
Right from the beginning.

456
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
Hard to believe.

457
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
I don't see.

458
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
You can be a principal, as long as you don't separate children from adults.

459
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
Skillful trick principal.

460
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
I finally got my revenge.

461
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
All doing villain hooks.

462
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
I had fun.

463
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
Thank you for coming.

464
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
Thanks.

465
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
Oh principal.

466
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
Don't sell, you can't.

467
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
I run faster.

468
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
I think our contest was left unsettled.

469
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
I'm wrong.

470
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
Don't brag, son.

471
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:03,000
I never would have believed that grandma papa was such a badass.

472
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
Me neither.

473
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
I have to tell mom about this.

474
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
Tell me!

475
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
Wait and see.

476
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
Thanks.

477
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
Thanks.

478
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
Thanks.

479
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
Thanks.

480
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
Thanks.

481
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
Thanks.

482
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
Thanks.

483
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
Thanks.
