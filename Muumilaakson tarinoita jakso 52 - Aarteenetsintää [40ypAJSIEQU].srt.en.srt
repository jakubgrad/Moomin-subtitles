1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Ugh, what a beauty to see through a magnifying glass.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
What wonders of nature.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Oh, and so many kinds.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Hundreds of thousands of species.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Sorry, good morning.

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Oh, morning!

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
This is a small road to a lonely mountain.

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Take it straight ahead, so you can't get lost.

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Thank you. May I ask what you researched so closely?

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Flower.

11
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,000
A flower?

12
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
A glorious flower.

13
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
A flower? Oh my god, flower.

14
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Moomin!

15
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Wet girl!

16
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Sorry, you won't have to wait for Moomin.

17
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,000
What a man. Have you ever seen flowers before?

18
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:04,000
At least he hasn't looked at them. I guess I was looking for something completely different.

19
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
What?

20
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Jaa.

21
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Hello to me who has found a new place for the garden.

22
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Well, not yet.

23
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
A new garden?

24
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Haven't I told you.

25
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I'm not, but it looks like you are to mamma.

26
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Yeah, my garden is way too small for the current mess.

27
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Thank you, Mummy Moomin.

28
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
My wife and I have been thinking for the last few days.

29
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Where could you find an area large enough for a new flower garden?

30
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Well, there is no matter how much land is in the neighborhood.

31
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:42,000
But it should be near my house on the south slope by the water.

32
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:47,000
I see. Share, then it's more difficult.

33
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
What the hell is that man doing?

34
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Hi there, Looking for something?

35
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I investigated.

36
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
What?

37
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Rock, find out how old it is, i.e. from what period it comes from.

38
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Well how old is it?

39
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Remain the adult of the season.

40
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Really?

41
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Not very much.

42
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Sounds old to me.

43
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Well, such a young man, you won't mind.

44
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
I would like to continue research now.

45
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Of course, sorry.

46
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
No, I have another question.

47
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Is there anywhere you can get your decent night here, Jan?

48
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Sure, just come back tonight.

49
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
I still have another question.

50
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Is there anywhere you can get your decent night here, Jan?

51
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Sure, sure, just go back to Moominvalley.

52
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Oh, how did you know I came through Moomin Valley?

53
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
We met before.

54
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
You were amazed when we looked at the flowers.

55
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Right, you look familiar.

56
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Or did I surprise myself?

57
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Oh, and you laughed.

58
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,000
So watch as I search for gold for my work.

59
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Honey, have you searched here?

60
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Not yet, but all the stones must be looked at and the formation of the rock must be studied.

61
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
That's the only way to find a vein of gold.

62
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:21,000
You were very surprised when we were looking at the flowers.

63
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Well, I imagined you also studying the rock, because it interests me.

64
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Yes, of course.

65
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Have you ever found gold in the world?

66
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Yeh, of course.

67
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Oh, I'd like to be a gold digger too.

68
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Oh, I guess you like gold.

69
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Yes.

70
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000
I like shiny things too.

71
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:45,000
The best part of this game is when you find gold.

72
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
I don't care about flowers.

73
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Jaha, or do you think that there is gold in Moominvalley too?

74
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Not from Moominvalley.

75
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Aha, is that absolutely certain?

76
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Yes it is.

77
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Munni said that you are interested in the Moomin Valley rocks.

78
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
It's true, I wanted to get it in shape.

79
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Where are you going next?

80
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:19,000
There may be some gold that has migrated from elsewhere in the lonely mountains here, but not a gold vein.

81
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Just don't ask me to reveal where I'm looking for gold.

82
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Of course not, I don't want urki.

83
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Behind the lonely mountains.

84
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Peace out Moomin, it would be heavenly to have a decent dinner again.

85
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Well, I guess you're not home often.

86
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Well no, real gold diggers are looking all the time.

87
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
And I don't have anyone at home with a bucket.

88
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
No you you.

89
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
You are a nice family.

90
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:59,000
What do you say, mom, if we keep the gold digger with us as long as he's comfortable?

91
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,000
What's up, it's fun when you have guests.

92
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
I suggest I can't stay any longer.

93
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:09,000
I'll have to see you to continue looking for gold again first thing tomorrow morning.

94
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:17,000
However, the gold prospector fell ill that same evening with a high fever.

95
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
I think it's trouble.

96
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,000
There is nothing wrong with you, I hope you get better.

97
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
I think it's trouble.

98
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Mom, how is the patient?

99
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Time in high fever.

100
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Then he will have to stay here.

101
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Certainly. He hasn't eaten in three days.

102
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
In poor condition, he can't search.

103
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,000
I have to see if I can find a book about stones or gold.

104
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
I would give it to him to read.

105
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:10,000
I have to stop by the Moomin house to find the gold there.

106
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
How to find gold?

107
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
It's not so easy to learn.

108
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
I'm not a snuffer.

109
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Well, probably not. I'm only good at inu.

110
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Hello Moomin-Pekko!

111
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
What?

112
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,000
That man said there is no gold in the Moomins.

113
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
That's what he told his father.

114
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
But it doesn't have to be true.

115
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
What do you mean?

116
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:33,000
If I found gold in the Moomin, do you think I would tell the others?

117
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Yes, you have to be able to trust people.

118
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Hey, the seller is right.

119
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Remember how stealthily Ukkeli sneaked here.

120
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
He seemed tense.

121
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
By guarantee, he had found something.

122
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Where were you then and what did the gold prospector say to you?

123
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Hey, you're not serious about flipping and selling something.

124
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,000
I want to make sure there is no gold in the Moomins.

125
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,000
It would be horrible if people rushed here to dig for gold.

126
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
I think that would be wonderful.

127
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Oh Mr. Gold Digger.

128
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
What is your winner?

129
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Know him.

130
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Oh, you look much better already.

131
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Would you like a drink?

132
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
No thanks.

133
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Yes, you must eat or drink something.

134
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:43,000
My head is buzzing and anyway I have a bit of a uterus.

135
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Tell me how long I've been lying here.

136
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
It's starting to be the days of the week.

137
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:52,000
It's a week, Moompa.

138
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
So what?

139
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Maybe I should get a drink.

140
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
I'll give you some juice.

141
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:07,000
After that first glass of juice, the gold prospector's condition started to improve.

142
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:15,000
A week later, he was able to go for a leisurely walk in Moomin Valley.

143
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:30,000
By then, a rumor had spread everywhere that a famous gold digger was looking for gold in Moomin Valley.

144
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:42,000
You have liked me so well that I ought to have a drink.

145
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,000
I should have a drink.

146
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,000
I should have a drink.

147
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,000
I should have a drink.

148
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:59,000
You've taken such good care of me that I can't thank you enough.

149
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:03,000
The first gold ore I found, Kimpale.

150
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:07,000
And you have kept it as a memory ever since.

151
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:13,000
It has brought good luck over the years, but now I think I'll find gold without good luck.

152
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Hold on, Kimpale.

153
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:19,000
I'll put Moominpapa's manuscript on top of the bundle as a paper weight.

154
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
That's what it's for.

155
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
No, don't.

156
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Then there's this.

157
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
It looks like a map.

158
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Right. It is said to be the treasure map of a famous pirate.

159
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Treasure map?

160
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,000
No, but that's probably just a false assumption.

161
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Oh my goodness, just like Moominvalley.

162
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,000
You are right. That's it.

163
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Familiar, crack. I know that rock.

164
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:53,000
As I said, the map is almost certainly faked.

165
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,000
I typed paper, the typefaces are too new.

166
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Maybe the map is just a joke.

167
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:04,000
But since it's from Moominvalley, I thought you'd want to keep it.

168
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Excellent. I suggest we all go treasure hunting.

169
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Do it, but don't dig yourself into exhaustion.

170
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Mr. Goo-seekers!

171
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
What, little sell?

172
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Have you searched for this treasure yourself?

173
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,000
You climbed over the cliff to Moomin Valley.

174
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Yeah, true.

175
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,000
I'm sure there's a big crack in the rock.

176
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,000
If so, at least I didn't notice it.

177
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Well maybe, I believe you.

178
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:38,000
But on the map this cracked rock is drawn much closer to the sea.

179
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Isn't that right, Moomin?

180
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Yeah, I guess. That's right.

181
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Oh, oh right?

182
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Well, there you have it.

183
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,000
I'm not interested in treasures.

184
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
The map is a joke.

185
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
See you soon!

186
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Good luck!

187
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:07,000
So Koolanetsija said goodbye to the people of the Moomin house.

188
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Now we go looking.

189
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Yes, treasure.

190
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Mom, will you come?

191
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:22,000
I'm coming. Sometimes you have to do nice things.

192
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Mom, this is not cool.

193
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Not at all. There are treasures after all.

194
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:33,000
That's true. Even the koola finder has definitely been looking for treasure.

195
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
We're going to look for it.

196
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,000
I don't think we've been seen.

197
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Good.

198
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Why do we have to hide?

199
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Digging for treasures is secret.

200
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Snuff, smiley!

201
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Hide!

202
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Come forward. I know you are there.

203
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Let me look sometimes.

204
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Aha, right?

205
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Here. This is where the crack is.

206
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
There's a crack in that too.

207
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
I think it's too small.

208
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
This is definitely the one.

209
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Where are we going here?

210
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,000
East. We take 39 steps to the east.

211
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Are you sure it's not 39 meters?

212
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
It's always about the steps.

213
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Listen dad, we have pretty short legs.

214
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:54,000
And it isn't. Our body is longer than usual.

215
00:12:54,000 --> 00:13:05,000
One, two, three, four, five, six, one, two, three, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one, one.

216
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Unit, unit, unit, unit, unit, unit, unit, unit, unit, unit, unit, unit, unit, unit, unit, unit, unit, unit, unit, unit, unit, unit, unit, unit, unit, unit, unit, unit, unit, unit, unit, unit, unit, unit, unit, unit, unit, unit, unit, unit, unit, unit, unit, unit, y

217
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:55,920
unit, unit, unit, unit, unit unit, unit, unit, unit, unit, unit, unit, unit, unit, unit, more

218
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:57,920
To this point.

219
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:09,200
And you can't just see the treasure.

220
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:10,360
Did you believe in the treasure?

221
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:12,920
Well, of course I believed. And I believe.

222
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:16,600
Yes, but if that map is a mistake or just a joke.

223
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:17,800
And it isn't.

224
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:25,800
Someone else can continue.

225
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:26,920
I'll continue.

226
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:28,920
Heavy work.

227
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:31,920
Yes, it will suffer if you can find the treasure.

228
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:37,920
Dad, shall we dig a little further? If it was 39 meters.

229
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:40,920
It's possible too.

230
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:49,920
My faith would be like that if they dug a trench.

231
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:52,920
I hope papa Maltaa watches his back.

232
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:57,920
The Aare map is a suspected falsification.

233
00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:01,920
We have to dig from an ever wider radius.

234
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:03,920
Are you digging tomorrow too?

235
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:04,920
We dig.

236
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:07,920
I'll come again to see how you grind.

237
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:09,920
Rather! Jihuu!

238
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:13,920
I see! Now comes the enthusiastic companion.

239
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:16,920
Elegance! Why did you leave me alone?

240
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:19,920
Sorry Nipsu. It wasn't meant to be.

241
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:21,920
I want a gold mine too.

242
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:23,920
We don't dig for gold.

243
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:29,920
Don't try to string. Everyone says that the gold prospector has told you where the gold mine is.

244
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:31,920
Who all?

245
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:32,920
Well, everyone.

246
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:34,920
You are mistaken.

247
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:35,920
I can't.

248
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:37,920
We don't dig for gold.

249
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:38,920
Look Nipsu.

250
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:41,920
Moomin, what's wrong?

251
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:44,920
Moomin, are you done?

252
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:46,920
Interesting.

253
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:48,920
You found this nugget.

254
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:52,920
No, the gold digger gave it to us.

255
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:54,920
He has been digging there.

256
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:56,920
And now you are going to.

257
00:15:56,920 --> 00:15:58,920
Nothing of the kind.

258
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:02,920
Everyone in Moomin Valley knows that you dig for gold.

259
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:04,920
Listen now, Hemuli.

260
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:06,920
Hi, hi, hi.

261
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:08,920
Moomin!

262
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:10,920
Moomin!

263
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:12,920
Moomin!

264
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:14,920
Hi, hi, hi.

265
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:19,920
It's a surprise that you can find gold right in the corner of your house.

266
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:22,920
Oh, Hemuli.

267
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:28,920
Morning, morning, morning.

268
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:29,920
Hello, Moomin.

269
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:31,920
Good morning, Nipsu.

270
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:33,920
I dig until dark.

271
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:34,920
Oh, Nipsu.

272
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:38,920
Are you sure you understood everything I told you yesterday?

273
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:41,920
Oh yes, you're not looking for gold in a vein, but in a treasure chest.

274
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:43,920
Much better that way.

275
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:47,920
Yeah, yeah, but we're not sure there's any treasure.

276
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:48,920
Or so.

277
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:50,920
Then I dig plain gold.

278
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:52,920
I'm about to get a headache.

279
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:54,920
There's Mrs. Vilionka.

280
00:16:58,920 --> 00:16:59,920
Listen dad.

281
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:02,920
Let's dig the cage so no one else finds our treasure.

282
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:04,920
You are right.

283
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:10,920
You are right.

284
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:12,920
You are right.

285
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:14,920
You are right.

286
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:16,920
You are right.

287
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:18,920
You are right.

288
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:20,920
You are right.

289
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:22,920
You are right.

290
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:24,920
You are right.

291
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:26,920
You are right.

292
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:28,920
You are right.

293
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:30,920
You are right.

294
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:32,920
You are right.

295
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:35,920
You are right.

296
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:45,920
Moominpapa.

297
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:49,920
Did you say I'm digging for gold in the right place?

298
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:52,920
This is actually a kind of new hobby.

299
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:57,920
A clumsy excuse. Nice good neighbors. I'll keep digging.

300
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:02,920
Dig in kids. We will defeat them.

301
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:08,920
Oh, oh. What will happen in Moomin Valley if we find the treasure?

302
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:12,920
What now? I hit something hard.

303
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:17,920
Dig carefully. Manually. Beware of immensely valuable treasure.

304
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:22,920
No.

305
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:31,920
The search for the treasure took a week. And nothing was found.

306
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:35,920
Moi.

307
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:56,920
No gold ore was found in Moomin Falls either, but real gold sand was found in the river.

308
00:18:56,920 --> 00:19:03,920
The mines were abandoned and everyone rushed to the river to wash the gold. Everyone except the Moomins.

309
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:06,920
Yes, the gold chips are impossibly small.

310
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:08,920
And wanted.

311
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:10,920
We have gold.

312
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:12,920
We have gold.

313
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:14,920
We have gold.

314
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:18,920
Yes, the gold chips are impossibly small.

315
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:20,920
And wanted.

316
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:22,920
Are you sad that you didn't find the treasure?

317
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:27,920
I don't really get exercise. The landscape does look quite untidy.

318
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:30,920
Poor thing, the potholes have to be filled.

319
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:33,920
Hi, I can help. And me.

320
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:35,920
Now invented. What did you come up with?

321
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:40,920
Hemuli, wouldn't this area be well suited for a new flower garden?

322
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:42,920
For a flower garden?

323
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:46,920
So. The country is so excited that half of the foundation work has been done.

324
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:49,920
I think this would be a perfect place.

325
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:51,920
You're right.

326
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:56,920
My house is close like this, by the river, and there is no shade.

327
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:59,920
Let's call it Gold Fever Park.

328
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:02,920
Great. Let's get down to business.

329
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:04,920
Clear.

330
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:18,920
The garden will be bigger, won't it just Hemuli?

331
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:22,920
Yeah. Well of course.
