1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Moomin had found an old homemade soccer ball outside.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,000
About!

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Ah! To!

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Not like this!

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Sell, what do you do?

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
I'm doing it.

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Don't bother, birdie.

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
It seems to work well, but give it to grain and bait.

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
For that purpose I have nothing to give.

10
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
I can become an even further forward catcher!

11
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
It makes no difference.

12
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
New again.

13
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
I can become an even further forward catcher!

14
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
It makes no difference.

15
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Another new story.

16
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
The beginning is the most important.

17
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Come on now, come on now, come on now.

18
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Share, share, my retinas are flooded with images.

19
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
This makes a great story.

20
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
The blue sky arched over the blue sea.

21
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Or the green sea?

22
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
No, dear heavens.

23
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
The distant horizon with seagulls.

24
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
You sound good.

25
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Or a flea.

26
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
You hear sounds.

27
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
You hear sounds.

28
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
You hear sounds.

29
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Sad, bright.

30
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
No, it's a bit different.

31
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Not blue sky.

32
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
The pictures go by so fast that I can't keep up.

33
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
I have to start right now.

34
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
How did this happen?

35
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Wake up...

36
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
The chair broke.

37
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Oh, I guess I got too excited.

38
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
What happened now?

39
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Uh, my desk chair broke.

40
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
No you, you.

41
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
I take the chair out onto the porch.

42
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
I'll open the door.

43
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Please.

44
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Thanks.

45
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Can you fix it?

46
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:37,000
It's not difficult, you just need glue.

47
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Well, yes, you can.

48
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Ha, you danced on a chair!

49
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Yeah, if you need that information now.

50
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Mamma, do you know where the glue is?

51
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
I remember seeing it in the basement.

52
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
I'll go get it.

53
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Oh, I'll come along.

54
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Psy, age is over.

55
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Moominpappa can get new ones.

56
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Will come.

57
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Thus.

58
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Baby, you're a lousy player.

59
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Sorry pinch.

60
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Is the pregnant pack a mess?

61
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Birds startle.

62
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Hey, what are you doing there?

63
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
We're going to the beach soon, are you coming too?

64
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
As soon as I catch the bird.

65
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Hey, who can I feed.

66
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Let it come.

67
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Did you hurt yourself?

68
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:45,000
I hurt, what is dad's chair doing here?

69
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
The chair is perfect.

70
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Isn't there enough here?

71
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Would you put some warm water so I can melt the glue?

72
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Yes, papa.

73
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Jaha, where is the shoe pinching now?

74
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:06,000
When Nipsu kicked the ball too high and I would run to catch it...

75
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
It wasn't really our fault at all.

76
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Nipsu kicked the ball badly.

77
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Not when Moomin wasn't looking ahead.

78
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Ah, what's the matter?

79
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
I don't think I understand.

80
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Your office chair is nothing but stilts.

81
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
what did you say

82
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Sorry dad.

83
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
It was an accident.

84
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
The chair was already broken.

85
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:51,000
And it's true, grandma brought the chair out when the gig itself was broken.

86
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Is that so, dad?

87
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Hey, just go back to playing.

88
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Oh, what a relief.

89
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
I was quite worried.

90
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Come on, to repair work.

91
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Let's go then.

92
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Yeah, there's a Moomin.

93
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Father, I can stay to help you.

94
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:18,000
I'll handle this alone, thanks.

95
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
You can go and play with others in peace.

96
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Dad was upset that the writing chair broke.

97
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
It's probably Moompa's favorite chair.

98
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Couldn't granny troll try to find a new, better chair for her father?

99
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
It's not that easy now.

100
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Oh, but my brother Niisk could know.

101
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Let's ask the neighbors to bring their extra chairs to Mumipapa.

102
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,000
I'll get down to business right away.

103
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Don't worry, your dad can fix a chair.

104
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
He is so skilled.

105
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Don't be in the mood to get upset over one broken chair.

106
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
We'll come before.

107
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
It cannot be glued.

108
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,000
At least it's a goddamn big job.

109
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:11,000
I have to go write as long as the story is fresh in my mind.

110
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:17,000
I have already forgotten what quality faucet I connect to the sky if the sea is blue.

111
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,000
I need to write at least the body.

112
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Huh!

113
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Strangely, I'm not in the writing mood at all.

114
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
What can we invent here?

115
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Well, let's throw away the old rotisko and have a new chair.

116
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Ka's dad?

117
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Not even a body is born now, but the first chapter has to be considered.

118
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Share, oh oh.

119
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Cheating.

120
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,000
It was already on my lips.

121
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Jaa.

122
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Don't worry, muvi papa!

123
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Even the first bird remains uncaught.

124
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Jaa.

125
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
The feed appears to be bad.

126
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Sell, has it been caught?

127
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Well no, the birds here are some stupid species.

128
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,000
The chair is still unrepaired. where is dad

129
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:12,000
I don't know, I don't know how to fix a chair.

130
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Oh!

131
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Father, I came!

132
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Hello, Moomin troll.

133
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Go inside.

134
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Don't you have time to fix the chair?

135
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Tomorrow. It doesn't take long when the plans are clear.

136
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Dad, Can you write on that chair?

137
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Of course, I'm writing right now.

138
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Don't bother.

139
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Oh yes, mom said the food is on the table.

140
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Good, my stomach rumbled.

141
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:05,000
I'll just write a few words now that I'm up to speed.

142
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Yes.

143
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Come sleep well.

144
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Come sleep well.

145
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Doll, doll.

146
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Korina has more sweets as well.

147
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Come to sleep, come to sleep.

148
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Who is there?

149
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Oh sell, you're sell.

150
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
What are you doing there on the porch?

151
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Wait, you can't come!

152
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
What? I didn't die what you said.

153
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Don't come any closer!

154
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Uh!

155
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Are you still chasing bird parks?

156
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Is Moomin Pekko home?

157
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
No.

158
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Right? Well where has he gone?

159
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
I don't know!

160
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Hello, little snuff.

161
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,000
You seem to be in a big hurry.

162
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Yep, dad's writing chair broke.

163
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Oh, that big dark office chair.

164
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Yep, the backrest needs to be replaced.

165
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,000
This branch could be suitable for that purpose.

166
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,000
It was an ancient chair.

167
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Couldn't Moominpa get a new one?

168
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:40,000
No. Writing only fits on that chair.

169
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Well, not necessarily, but of course I believe what you said.

170
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,000
I'm kind of to blame for the chair breaking.

171
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
That's why I'm trying to fix it.

172
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Aijaha, but listen Moomin peko.

173
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
That branch is not there to lean on.

174
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Right?

175
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Maybe the branch is curved enough,

176
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:02,000
but for woodwork you must always use properly dried wood.

177
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Wet wood.

178
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:09,000
I heard from the seller that the chair with Moominpapa's writing on it has broken.

179
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:13,000
This was my father's favorite chair, but now Moompa gets it.

180
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Thank you, Mymmeli.

181
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
This is old.

182
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
I have changed.

183
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
I have changed.

184
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
I have changed.

185
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
I have changed.

186
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
I have changed.

187
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
I have changed.

188
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
I have changed.

189
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Thank you, Mymmeli.

190
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:37,000
This is old, but it is surprisingly comfortable to sit on.

191
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Just try it.

192
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Very friendly.

193
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:46,000
I have designed this special chair to suit all body types.

194
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Can I take some measurements?

195
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:56,000
I estimated your dimensions correctly.

196
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:05,000
That's it, now the chair is adjusted to your measurements.

197
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Thank you, Niisku.

198
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
I thank the gentleman for seeing the baby.

199
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:13,000
I can give it the argo it deserves.

200
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Now everyone go in and have some tea.

201
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Feel good.

202
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,000
First I carry the chair to Moominpapa's study.

203
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Oh no, I'll carry it myself.

204
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,000
And you don't sit and write?

205
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:33,000
What a surprise to see Mymmeli here with the chairs.

206
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,000
And more people are coming.

207
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Hemulik also had his penkovaiva.

208
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Moominpapa!

209
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Is what?

210
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:45,000
I place the chair next to the table so we can check the height.

211
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Come up.

212
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Ha, it's fine.

213
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Niisku, miss, don't roar!

214
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,000
My bird's fathers are aiming again.

215
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Ha, someone has tripped over the wire.

216
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
They would use their eyes.

217
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Ha, I'm running out of patience.

218
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
They would even fix it.

219
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Ha, come back.

220
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
I can't take it.

221
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Who among you silly birds cares?

222
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Stay in the sky.

223
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,000
That's the end of catching birds.

224
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Hey!

225
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Dad said it wasn't my fault when the chair broke.

226
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,000
But I think he's trying to comfort me.

227
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:37,000
If only another chair would suit dad.

228
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:41,000
I can sit on a chair like a chair when I read and write.

229
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:46,000
There is so much trolling in this world that when you get older.

230
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
And has always done the same way.

231
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Some other way did not create any way, no matter how much you wanted to.

232
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:58,000
But I find it boring to always do things the same way.

233
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:02,000
We're probably not old enough yet.

234
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Stupid or not, if your father thinks you can't write without his old chair.

235
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
He can't.

236
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
You get chocolate.

237
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Oh thank you.

238
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Warm.

239
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Listen.

240
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Bring the body of the crank behind your back.

241
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Oh, is this what you mean?

242
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Exactly that. What would you say about that?

243
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
How so what?

244
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:40,000
I thought it would make a good back for papa's chair.

245
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
So?

246
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:46,000
It is dry and in the form of the right law.

247
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:52,000
What do you think? Wouldn't that be good?

248
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Snuff, Can I have it?

249
00:14:55,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Of course you can. Do you want me to help you fix it?

250
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,000
No thanks. I'll try myself.

251
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,000
It was a day.

252
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Oh, what a number of chairs came to the house.

253
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:25,000
I'd say something else, mom. Yes, there is still kindness in the world.

254
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Dad, maybe you'll qualify for one of them?

255
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Perhaps. Good night.

256
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Good night.

257
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Good night.

258
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Ai.

259
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Ah, that's quite fitting.

260
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,000
It tickles.

261
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Has it always tickled? Perhaps. I just haven't noticed before.

262
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:54,000
I should have oiled the mechanism anyway to maintain the chair better.

263
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:58,000
This chair has served.

264
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,000
This chair has served for a long time.

265
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Hey.

266
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
Father.

267
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,000
Good morning, my boy.

268
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:08,000
Good morning. What are you doing here on the porch?

269
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:12,000
I could ask you the same thing.

270
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
What do you have?

271
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:18,000
I have made a new backrest. Do he pins fit?

272
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Let's see. Beautiful work. You're such a sucker.

273
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,000
Let's try already. I absolutely can't wait.

274
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
Me neither.

275
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
They fit their jets.

276
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:46,000
Oh Moomin, you don't know what this means to me.

277
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,000
The chair has already come to life.

278
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:52,000
It still lacks varnish.

279
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
I try how it feels to sit.

280
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:58,000
What's up? Move a little further, my boy.

281
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
About.

282
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:06,000
Yes, it feels comfortable.

283
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
Did the chair turn out decent?

284
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:13,000
Of course there was. I can already feel the inspiration taking over me.

285
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Thanks Moomin.

286
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:18,000
Think nothing of it. I hope your book turns out well.

287
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,000
Oops. Necessarily.

288
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,000
The Moomin could have gone.

289
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:30,000
I came a long way for nothing.

290
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
Hello! Take a break already!

291
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
Hey.

292
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
Hey.

293
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
Hey.

294
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
Hey.

295
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
Hey.

296
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:56,000
Hello, Snuff-muikkunen. Come along too.

297
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:00,000
We go to the beach to play ball.

298
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,000
Come after. Hello.

299
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:14,000
Everything was back to normal in the Moomin house when Moominpa got his old chair back.

300
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:18,000
Moomin was tired from nightly napping.

301
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:24,000
Nuuska Muikkunen played him this tune as sleep music.
