1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Coming, coming! There's a Moomin house over there.

2
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,000
It had started raining that day in the early afternoon.

3
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Everyone was sitting inside when Tuutikki came to the village.

4
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Good evening, Moomin.

5
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Hey, come in.

6
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Mother, Tuutikki came.

7
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Ninni, please come in.

8
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Aren't you alone?

9
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
No, I have Ninni with me.

10
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Nini?

11
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Come in.

12
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
There's no one there.

13
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Oh, he's there even if you can't see him.

14
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Is there?

15
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
There is. Ninni is just very, very shy.

16
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
I leave the door open. Come in when you want.

17
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Oh my, he's soaking wet.

18
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Maybe it doesn't matter if it's invisible.

19
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Get wet, fun.

20
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
What is everyone staring at?

21
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:47,000
You know that if someone is startled very often,

22
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
secondly, he can become completely invisible.

23
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Isn't that right?

24
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Yes, an Aunt has taken care of Ninni out of sheer duty.

25
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Auntie doesn't like Ninni at all and is therefore absolutely terrible at this point.

26
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Auntie doesn't Scream and doesn't get angry. You would understand that.

27
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:13,000
He's just chillingly ironic. It's terrible, absolutely terrible.

28
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
What does ironic mean?

29
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Well, suppose you trip and land in the middle of the tea table.

30
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
What would your mother do?

31
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
He would ask, were you hurt?

32
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,000
And many would be upset, but this, Auntie would say,

33
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:34,000
you may think that's dancing, but don't dance in food anyway.

34
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
That's irony.

35
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Ugh, disgusting.

36
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Auntie was terribly ironic about the day

37
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:47,000
and so my Ninni polo began to gradually fade and fade,

38
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:53,000
until last Friday he suddenly disappeared completely from sight.

39
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Terrible.

40
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Aunt gave me Ninni,

41
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:03,000
because he can't take care of invisible relatives.

42
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Well, what did you do to aunt? Did you muzzle him properly?

43
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,000
That kind of thing doesn't work at all on ironic people.

44
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:19,000
I took Ninni to me and now I brought her here so that you would make her visible again.

45
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Very flattering, but...

46
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Moomin mom if anyone can do it. And Moomin can play with him.

47
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Tuutikki, is Ninni talking?

48
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
No, unfortunately, he doesn't speak.

49
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Goodness.

50
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
So what could we play?

51
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Of course, Ninni wins if we play hide and seek.

52
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Auntie hung a tie around her neck. Do you hear where he moves?

53
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Oops, the door opened.

54
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
It must be Ninni.

55
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Get out of the rain already, Ninni.

56
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
The Moomin house is now your new home.

57
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
The Moomins are very benevolent.

58
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,000
This here is Moomin papa and this is Moomin mamma and this is...

59
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Just like mom, sister, Nipsu and Moomin the Goblin.

60
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:26,000
We're just at the tea table. Will you have tea if you can drink now?

61
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
I'll bring you some juice.

62
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:38,000
I would like to see how the juice flows inside him. This way, Ninni.

63
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:47,000
That's all there is to it. Until then, unfortunately, I can't tell you about Ninni.

64
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
You'll make it somehow.

65
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
There will be no difficulties here.

66
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Is this here, Ninni?

67
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Well, I think I'll leave here too. There is one thing and another at home.

68
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:12,000
I'll try to drop in here from time to time to see how you guys are doing.

69
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Let's do it like that.

70
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
What now?

71
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,000
It occurred to me that you had some extra residents here.

72
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:29,000
It was. It was dense and windy. They moved out last week.

73
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Right, good.

74
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Oops, you finished drinking. Will you take more?

75
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,000
I hope you like it.

76
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Ninni, will you come up with me?

77
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Ninni, will you come up with me?

78
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Tight is nice.

79
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Here is your room.

80
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:23,000
I leave the juice on the bedside table so you can drink it whenever you want.

81
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Oh, do you want to go to bed?

82
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Just get under a warm blanket.

83
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Ninni, if you get a strange feeling at night or loneliness starts to bother you.

84
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
You can come wake me up.

85
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Come on, just ring my tight ear.

86
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Beautiful dreams.

87
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Is he sleeping?

88
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Sleeping.

89
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Could you find a cure for Ninni in your grandmother's notebook with foolproof home remedies?

90
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Is there a cure for invisibility?

91
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:10,000
I don't remember directly, but we'll see.

92
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
I believe in the power of medicine.

93
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
I know that, honey.

94
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Let's go to the invisibility medicine.

95
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,000
I don't remember directly, but we'll see.

96
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
I believe in the power of medicine.

97
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Honey, I'll go find out.

98
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
I want to see Ninn.

99
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
That's it.

100
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Evil eye, heavy mind, hanging tail.

101
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Ha, that's it.

102
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:56,000
The recipe was written on the back of the envelope in shaky handwriting.

103
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:00,000
But yes it was right because it said so.

104
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:06,000
A cure if someone starts to get foggy and hard to see.

105
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,000
I hope the medicine worked.

106
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Grandma's recipes are always delicious.

107
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:32,000
I tell you what. Is Ninni still sleeping?

108
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Look, Ninn's shoes are visible.

109
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Cotton daddy.

110
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Sell tomorrow.

111
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Has he gotten up yet?

112
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
No on, on.

113
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Where is it? I guess he hasn't eaten yet.

114
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,000
I would assume he is in the dining room.

115
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Oh my goodness.

116
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Where is it?

117
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Where is it?

118
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Be quieter.

119
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Ninni takes medicine.

120
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Single sip Moomin for troll delight.

121
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Like that.

122
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,000
The medicine should take effect in a couple of hours.

123
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Ninn's shoes float in the air.

124
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Yes, the shoes have appeared.

125
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
They look funny.

126
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Those are beautiful legs.

127
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:00,000
It's unlikely that mummy's medicines will work quickly either.

128
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:05,000
You must look terrible when you prefer to go invisible.

129
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Don't mind the small sale.

130
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,000
He always talks in that style.

131
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:14,000
You still can't see any food crawling inside him.

132
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
What are we going to do?

133
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Flour.

134
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Shall we go to the mushroom?

135
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Boring, I can find a single one.

136
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
I will find.

137
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Ninni, shall we go?

138
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Settled.

139
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Who collects the most mushrooms?

140
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:35,000
You must tell me which mushrooms are edible.

141
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Let's tell.

142
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Father, father.

143
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Look, Ninn's shoes are already visible.

144
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Moomin mamma's medicines are known for their effectiveness.

145
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:52,000
It can't be caused by the medicine.

146
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:56,000
I guess the medicine worked faster because of the absence of the body.

147
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Or because aunt is far away.

148
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Aunt is far away.

149
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Aunt is far away.

150
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Aunt is far away.

151
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Aunt is far away.

152
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
booked

153
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Musi

154
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
I have to

155
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Aunt is far away.

156
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:22,000
deb

157
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Libra?

158
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Ai!

159
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Awesome! You have collected hard!

160
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:02,000
An awful lot of mushrooms!

161
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,000
I only have half that much.

162
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,000
How much do you have, Moomin?

163
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Four times more than I have!

164
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,000
You've never collected so much.

165
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,000
There's something rotten here.

166
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Oh, they were Ninn's mushrooms!

167
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Eh, I guess so.

168
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:40,000
That terrible aunt never let Ninny go to the mushroom, so now she really has a cold!

169
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Ninn probably had a permit at her aunt's place to only harvest.

170
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Oh how awful, oh how awful!

171
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Stink, what does he want?

172
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Do I bite him?

173
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Long time no see.

174
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:03,000
It would still be in between. Last time you dipped my swimming trunks in glue.

175
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Hehehe, that was fun!

176
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,000
What is that basket swinging over there?

177
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,000
I don't mean to be rude, but I won't tell.

178
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Jukra, what could you do while invisible.

179
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Ninni, I'll take care of you. Let's go.

180
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Come now, Ninni!

181
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Hey, hey, hey! Is Ninni the real name?

182
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Or a species name?

183
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Stinker, stop now! You startle Ninn.

184
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Is she a girl? Was it Ninni?

185
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,000
It's a fitting nickname.

186
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Varo, Haisuli.

187
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Well, from what, that's the question.

188
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Don't tease Ninni or I'll get really mad.

189
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Without shoes, he would make a great bank robber.

190
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Don't imagine! The nipple becomes completely visible.

191
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Yesterday, his legs started to show.

192
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,000
And at this very moment they disappear.

193
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Thus!

194
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Stink, it was your fault.

195
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Tell Mummy Moomin and Papa Moomin that Ninni will make a great bank robber.

196
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Ninni doesn't agree to that, and besides, we're going to make her visible throughout the pool.

197
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:28,000
He has also taken mom's magic potion.

198
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Whose basket is this?

199
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Mine and mine.

200
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Oh unusual, really beautiful.

201
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Our catch was small because Ninni collected all the mushrooms.

202
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:53,000
It's okay if there are few mushrooms, but when you can't eat these mushrooms.

203
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:58,000
This is a poison ivy, and this is a toadstool.

204
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Watch out for these two mushrooms.

205
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:04,000
I guess this is Moomin the troll and Mipsu's mushrooms.

206
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,000
We didn't collect toadstools.

207
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:13,000
You guys have a little less, but this is panther toadstool, and what about this one?

208
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Both have fly agaric.

209
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Oops, but I don't see a single toadstool in Ninn's basket.

210
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:26,000
How has he collected so much on his own?

211
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Ninni hoi, come out, where are you?

212
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Moomin mama, it's called Ninni.

213
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Ninni, I would call this a beautiful mushroom basket.

214
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:46,000
Hey, I saw Ninni's legs.

215
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Great Ninni, you know, he gets to see your face too.

216
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:56,000
It only takes one joke, don't worry about the smelly mouth, he's just threatening.

217
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Don't think about bad things, that's my life instruction.

218
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:07,000
And mine is to bite him that teases you.

219
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:15,000
If someone is such a good mushroom picker, I think they deserve to be fully featured, right?

220
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:21,000
Look, her skirt is visible.

221
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
Ninni, you're making progress.

222
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Good luck, I can't wait to see you in full.

223
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:34,000
It will happen soon, but I don't think mouse gray is your color.

224
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Tomorrow, sleep as long as you are sleepy.

225
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Good night, Ninni.

226
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
Hey, mom's gone.

227
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:51,000
What the hell are you doing? Do you know what time it is?

228
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
How do you like this?

229
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
It's really pretty.

230
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:02,000
Nice to have someone in the house who wears clothes. How does it look on Ninn?

231
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,000
What is this?

232
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Hair band.

233
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
Good morning, Papa Moomin.

234
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
Morning, you are early.

235
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Where is Ninni?

236
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Still sleeping.

237
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
You are up early.

238
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
How much tail is visible?

239
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
I am.

240
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
I am.

241
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
I am.

242
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
I am.

243
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
I am.

244
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
I am.

245
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
I am.

246
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
I am.

247
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
I am.

248
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
I am.

249
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
It is.

250
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:54,000
I am.

251
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
I am.

252
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
I am.

253
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
I am.

254
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
I am.

255
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
I am.

256
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
As containers.

257
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
I am.

258
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
I am.

259
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:18,000
I hope she noticed the Dress I had put up.

260
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
The dress looks just right.

261
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
Now you know where to talk.

262
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,000
So.

263
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
Yes.

264
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
can you take

265
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,000
Dress!

266
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,000
Dress!

267
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,000
Don't live!

268
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
Don't start.

269
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,000
Dress!

270
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
Dress!

271
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,000
Dress!

272
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,000
Dress!

273
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
Dress!

274
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
That's what it looks like to me.

275
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,000
Dress!

276
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,000
Dress!

277
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,000
Dress!

278
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
Yes, yes.

279
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,000
Thank you all for everything.

280
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
He can talk!

281
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:09,000
Although Ninn's face was not yet visible, it was a great relief to hear her speak.

282
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:16,000
It feels stupid to talk to someone who doesn't answer, and then it's easy to say something stupid.

283
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:21,000
Thanks for watching the video!
