1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Heavy storm.

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
I can't sleep.

3
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Hats.

4
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Tomorrow we should go sailing.

5
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
But there is a high wave in the sea now.

6
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
We can hardly leave.

7
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
The day is shining.

8
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
I don't believe it.

9
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
The day is shining.

10
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
The day is shining.

11
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
The day is shining.

12
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
You wouldn't believe that it stormed violently yesterday.

13
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Not so.

14
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Good morning.

15
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Good morning.

16
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Good morning.

17
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
After all, you woke up from such a nightmare.

18
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,000
I barely slept last night because of the fierce wind.

19
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
But look at the weather now.

20
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
The storm brought us clear skies.

21
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
The seed begins to refresh the sea air.

22
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
They always say that a storm cleans the air.

23
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Good morning.

24
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Hey listen, why don't you go to the beach already?

25
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Has the sea calmed down?

26
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Can we sail?

27
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Certainly, now look at the calm and the beautiful.

28
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
There may not be enough fire.

29
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
And you can probably find fun things on the beach.

30
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Yes, I saw beautiful shoes, for example.

31
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Granny, let's go already.

32
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Well, yeah, that's fine.

33
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Coconut.

34
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Show.

35
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
The nut is mine because I found it.

36
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
You know how to be childish.

37
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
When will you grow up?

38
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
There is sweet milk inside the coconut.

39
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
It's just salt water.

40
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Lovely sweet milk that takes the tongue out of the mouth.

41
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
There was Rappu in the coconut.

42
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Good day, Rappu Nanen.

43
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:48,000
I hear a whisper that comes from the far ocean.

44
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Oh gosh, someone cried.

45
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,000
True, it is crying.

46
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Johan is a freak.

47
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
There must be something inside the shell.

48
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Whenever I look.

49
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Let's investigate.

50
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Ah, I see nothing at all.

51
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
It's really strange.

52
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
It's really strange.

53
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
It's really strange.

54
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
It's really strange.

55
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
It's really strange.

56
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
It's really strange.

57
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
It's really strange.

58
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
I can't see anything at all.

59
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
That's where the crying is.

60
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Let me have a look.

61
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
It's not in Simpuka.

62
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Hi, selling.

63
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
what are you crying

64
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Hey, get out of the water already.

65
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
why are you crying

66
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Hey, it's a mermaid.

67
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
We have to catch him.

68
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
I guess you can't do that.

69
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Come on, now.

70
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Momipeko is waiting.

71
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Don't leave me.

72
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Hey, slow down.

73
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Don't cry.

74
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
We know how to help you.

75
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,000
I haven't seen you here before.

76
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,000
I had to get rid of the others when we hurried to the southern sea.

77
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Now I'm all alone.

78
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Have you hurt yourself?

79
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
The storm surprised me when I was looking for companions.

80
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,000
The wave brought me here.

81
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
That night storm.

82
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Go applies.

83
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
It sure hurts.

84
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
We have to do something.

85
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
You agree.

86
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Moomin mamma's liniment helps us when we have a pee.

87
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
But I'm not sure it works on mermaids.

88
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Yes, it should be waterproof.

89
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:20,000
The only medicine that heals our wounds is tears.

90
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Do you have tears?

91
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Oh tears? Just ordinary?

92
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,000
No, no. I'm a salmon snake.

93
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Oh what did you say?

94
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Something about salmon roe, I guess?

95
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
So.

96
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
what did you say

97
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Something about salmon roe, I guess?

98
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
A salmon snake's tear?

99
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:51,000
I don't think Moomin lives in the valleys with salmon snakes.

100
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,000
All right. We do what we can.

101
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Stay here and wait.

102
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Oh Moomin-Pekka, you are always so kind.

103
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Now you stick to it like a stick. And don't go swimming.

104
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,000
The tears of the salmon snake are probably oil spillage.

105
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
But we will do our best.

106
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Yeah, that's right.

107
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
I love the storm.

108
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,000
But why does it always break something?

109
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Healthy muuta.

110
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Joo.

111
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Mom and Dad, we need help.

112
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Good time, now what?

113
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
There is a wounded mermaid on the beach.

114
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
We have to go help.

115
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Well, it's a miracle.

116
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:47,000
The sea is a beast. Only swim when the sea is in a good mood.

117
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
You sound like a bitch.

118
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,000
And ugh, be careful what you say.

119
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Imagine, a mermaid can only be cured by the tears of a salmon snake.

120
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Do dragons live around here?

121
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Or do you need a salmon snake tear?

122
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Do you know where we can find a salmon snake?

123
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Joo.

124
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
I've seen one in a museum.

125
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Probably in some bone collection.

126
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,000
At least it doesn't bring tears.

127
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
You are right.

128
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Let me think.

129
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Salmon finger.

130
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Oh yeah, you're not sure.

131
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Do you know a salmon snake?

132
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Great.

133
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:32,000
I'm not sure he qualifies as a salmon snake.

134
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
What is he?

135
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Well, I guess he's some kind of Lizard.

136
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,000
We became friends many years ago.

137
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:44,000
I too have heard stories about Edvard the salmon snake.

138
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Dad listen, Do you think Edvard can save the mermaid?

139
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,000
And heal his wounds.

140
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,000
If he counts as a salmon snake?

141
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Listen to me, I think you should at least try.

142
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,000
I agree, we have to try our best.

143
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,000
But I have no idea where it is.

144
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:11,000
It's been a long time, but someone said they saw Edvard at the lake at the foot of the lonely mountains.

145
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
It's in those landscapes.

146
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
I guess he's not there anymore.

147
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Hey, let's go!

148
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Joo!

149
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,000
I hope Edvard hasn't gone anywhere.

150
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
I hope so too.

151
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:29,000
I haven't seen him in a long time.

152
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Hey!

153
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
That's the lake now.

154
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Beautiful, wonderful scenery.

155
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Hey, it's not a pleasure trip.

156
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Let's find Edvard as quickly as possible.

157
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Myy is right.

158
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Let's disperse.

159
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Nipsu and Myy search the lake.

160
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Moomin and the squishy lady are going with me.

161
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,000
All right. Myy and Nipsu will see each other later.

162
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Be careful that Edvard doesn't deposit.

163
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Very quiet.

164
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Edvard hides in the lake bed.

165
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
We have to call him out.

166
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Get it done.

167
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:11,000
No, where exactly are you pushing me?

168
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Stop it!

169
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
It hurts me!

170
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Sell! What exactly are you trying to do?

171
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Don't be afraid!

172
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Now!

173
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Help!

174
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Help me!

175
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
You are the bait.

176
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
I bark out Edvard.

177
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Let me go.

178
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Right away! Help!

179
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
There's something there.

180
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
I don't want to be eaten.

181
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Oops. Yes, it's quick power.

182
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Ah!

183
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Ah!

184
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
It was just a catfish.

185
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
How come?

186
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
It almost swallowed me.

187
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
There is pressure in the grass.

188
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
I guess not that.

189
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
It looks like a footprint.

190
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Hi sell and nip!

191
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Has Edvard been found?

192
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Help! Don't leave me!

193
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
A huge footprint.

194
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
What? Where?

195
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Is there a footprint here?

196
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
That's how it seems.

197
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
It's a big salmon snake.

198
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
The tracks lead there.

199
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Dad, let's go follow the tracks.

200
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Maybe we'll find Edvard.

201
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Clear!

202
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
This is where the footprints disappear.

203
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
It means...

204
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:50,000
The waterfall is so big that Edvard can take a shower under it.

205
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Look, there's a cave over there.

206
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Let's go there.

207
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
The cave looks deep.

208
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Doesn't seem like fun.

209
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Help!

210
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
What was your roar?

211
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
The sound must have come from the cave.

212
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
So it happened. Let's push in.

213
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
I am ghosts in my senses.

214
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
I'm afraid.

215
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Let's turn.

216
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Don't slip!

217
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
It was just a tiny drop of water.

218
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Just like that, go ahead.

219
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Try to hold on.

220
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Moomin comes soon and brings the salmon snake to the tear.

221
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Can't help but hope they find Edvard.

222
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:02,000
They will surely find it when papa is with you.

223
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Where could Edvard be?

224
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Let's try.

225
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Edward, Hitaka.

226
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Edvard, hi.

227
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
There's a Moominpapa here.

228
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Do you still remember me?

229
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Edvard!

230
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Huh, it's tiring.

231
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
I'll wait here.

232
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
I'm looking for happiness at work.

233
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Dullard. You do what you want.

234
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
So do I.

235
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
I'm hungry.

236
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
What sound is that?

237
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
You're going to have to.

238
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
As if the sound was coming from here.

239
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Help!

240
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
It stares.

241
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
It eats up minutes.

242
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
No, I don't taste good at all.

243
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Wow!

244
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Wow!

245
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Wow!

246
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Dude, what happened?

247
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Oh, Edvard.

248
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
We were right.

249
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Oh, that's it, Edvard.

250
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Oh, and nothing small.

251
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Hey, look. Tear, tear.

252
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Ack, ack sound as it falls.

253
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Falling.

254
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Did, did, did, did, did, did.

255
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
I got it.

256
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Also, try to help me somehow now.

257
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
You swallow a tear.

258
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Tolo, what did you do?

259
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
How can you be so stupid?

260
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Give back the tear.

261
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Edvard, hello, do you remember me?

262
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
It must have been years since we met.

263
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Dad seems to remember you.

264
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Oh, Kind Salmon Finger.

265
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
We need one tear from you.

266
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Sorry to trouble you.

267
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
We ask for your help.

268
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Cry one tear into this stable.

269
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
And if you don't cry, I will.

270
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Don't scare him.

271
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
When we explain why tears are needed,

272
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
he does understand.

273
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Really?

274
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Well then try to explain.

275
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
We need a tear from you,

276
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
that we can heal the wounded mermaid.

277
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
He can't swim at all

278
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
and suffered terrible pains.

279
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Of course we want to save him.

280
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Do you know a mermaid?

281
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Please think of something sad.

282
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
What are you going to do?

283
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
What's wrong with you?

284
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Hijalappas, I'm unkind!

285
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Dad, what does he mean?

286
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
I think he's saying

287
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
jump on the horses.

288
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Oh yeah, it's good!

289
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
I'll come too.

290
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
And me?

291
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Nepsu, please, I'm not coming.

292
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
I'm walking home.

293
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
No, he won't eat me!

294
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Father Edward understood us.

295
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
He clearly wants to save the mermaid.

296
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Yes, he is very kind.

297
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Yes, you will get well.

298
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Help is already near.

299
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Try to last.

300
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Hebs is falling!

301
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Edward is here!

302
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
We found him!

303
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Moomin came!

304
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Oh, where exactly are you?

305
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Here in the upper air!

306
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Here, here!

307
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Hello, you're Edward.

308
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Please save your mermaid tears.

309
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:32,000
He's getting weak already, hurry up.

310
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Edward, honey, please.

311
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
A tear from Pira.

312
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Teardrop!

313
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Teardrop!

314
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Teardrop!

315
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Not trying to hurry now.

316
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
Don't be rude to him.

317
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
It is not easy to cry on command.

318
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Could he help with the onion?

319
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
I have my own ways.

320
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
I'll try the frying pan.

321
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
Oh mermaid.

322
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
I can take a little longer.

323
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
You will get better.

324
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
Don't give up.

325
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Fight for your life.

326
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Don't give up!

327
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
You are saved!

328
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
Try to get fit!

329
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
Look at Edward.

330
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Edward cries.

331
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
The tears don't seem to help.

332
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Edward is not a real salmon snake then.

333
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Edward succeeded.

334
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
The sailors became healthy.

335
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Humdinger.

336
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
Edward did a good job.

337
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
You were kind.

338
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
We thank you.

339
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
We are all very grateful to you.

340
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
Thank you, Edward.

341
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
Thank you, Edward.

342
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
Thank you, Edward.

343
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
Thank you, Edward.

344
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
Thank you, Edward.

345
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
Thank you, Edward.

346
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
Thank you, Edward.

347
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
Thank you all

348
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
Thank you all

349
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
Thank you all

350
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
Thank you all

351
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
Thank you all

352
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Thank you all

353
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
Thank you all

354
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Thank you all

355
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
Thank you all

356
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
Thank you all

357
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,840
Thank you all

358
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:11,840
Thank you all

359
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
Thank you all

360
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
Thank you all

361
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:20,000
Thanks again. Goodbye.

362
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:25,000
Now you can swim in the southern sea.

363
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
Take care of yourself.

364
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
I am so happy.

365
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
A big octopus!

366
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:44,000
Mermaid! Keep your money!

367
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
Good!

368
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
Help! Help!

369
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:20,000
Thank you, Edward. Cars already for the second time.

370
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
Good luck to both of you.

371
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:31,000
Edward has become very caring.

372
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:34,000
He is a gallant cavalier.

373
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:38,000
It is, it is. Absolutely.

374
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:41,000
Like they probably were.

375
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:45,000
Edward, take the mermaid home safely.

376
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:48,000
Goodbye, mermaid.

377
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
Good!
