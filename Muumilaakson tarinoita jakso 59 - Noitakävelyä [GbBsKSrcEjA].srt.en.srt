1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Terribly boring.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
It is.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,000
What bores you?

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Would like to play with someone else.

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Just like me, for a change.

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
So yes.

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
With Alisa, although...

8
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
He hasn't been here in ages.

9
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Studying to become a witch requires a lot of effort.

10
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Maybe he will fly here one day.

11
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
And teaches us tricks too.

12
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Hey, what are you doing there?

13
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Nothing.

14
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Except you throw stones.

15
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Always the same old faces.

16
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
What do you mean?

17
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
It would be fun to play with a new friend.

18
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Well, I just came.

19
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
And me?

20
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
No variation whatsoever.

21
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
You'll miss it here.

22
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
I'm bored.

23
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I rest sometimes.

24
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Alisa!

25
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Sorry, I just stopped standing like a stone.

26
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
You stopped at the wrong time, my lady.

27
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
But when I missed so much.

28
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
It is an important exercise.

29
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
A witch must learn to be patient.

30
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
I already am.

31
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
You would teach those tricks.

32
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Well, recite your spell for me.

33
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Who is it?

34
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Don't say you've reached out.

35
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
How to enchant someone into a troupe.

36
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Or to do other magic if you have cast your own spell.

37
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
No way.

38
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
That?

39
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Ah, I'll just come.

40
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Enough, enough already.

41
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Now I will teach you a new thing.

42
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Hurrah!

43
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
What trick will you teach me?

44
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
I want to learn to fly.

45
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
First I teach you how to walk everywhere.

46
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
But I can walk.

47
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
No, no, me neither.

48
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,000
It's very different from your first flywheel.

49
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Oh, and the final air at the beginning is ten times bigger.

50
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
How many people can it fit?

51
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Yay, probably just two.

52
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:35,000
But the good thing about it is that it is as easy to fly as it is to walk.

53
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Like a witch with a broom?

54
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Broom flies my sorcery ship with the power of science.

55
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
But both fly?

56
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:47,000
In a way, but the broom is flying for all the wrong reasons.

57
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:54,000
On my plane, however, anyone can learn to fly.

58
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,000
So is it wrong to admire a witch's bone?

59
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Necessarily.

60
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Does Niisku show his platform?

61
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Too early.

62
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
I want to see it.

63
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Maybe Niisku won't get angry if I tell you just a little.

64
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
It carries two people.

65
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Then it's not an airship.

66
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
But it can make sudden turns.

67
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Just like walking.

68
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
That's how Niisku described it.

69
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Niisku's airship is surprisingly small.

70
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Why doesn't he show it to us?

71
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Yes, the time will come.

72
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Let's be patient.

73
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
I want to see right away.

74
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
What would you come up with here?

75
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Let's go see those.

76
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
I'm Alice.

77
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
You are interested in gas, Alisa.

78
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Yeah, I'm interested.

79
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
I have to feed the niisku.

80
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
I remembered that I am booked.

81
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Are you still afraid of the witch?

82
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
No, but witchcraft is suspect.

83
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Sell, is tomorrow ok?

84
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
It's the same, will you be a swamp lady too?

85
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Of course I will.

86
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Nipsu, are you busy tomorrow too?

87
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
I don't know yet, but you're missing something.

88
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Hmm, a very multifaceted question.

89
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Niisku thinks that science is more valuable than witchcraft.

90
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
That's the opinion of Niisku.

91
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,000
I think witchcraft is much nicer.

92
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
So do I.

93
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,000
The witch has only a bone.

94
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:41,000
At least Niisku's aircraft will be more comfortable.

95
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
A broom handle is a hard place to sit.

96
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Grandma, can't you get a little broom ready for this?

97
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Birch's toes would fly, but I'm too tired.

98
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
So do I.

99
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Studying to be a witch is hard work.

100
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Teaching to be a witch is hard work.

101
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,000
If the apprentice takes all day to learn witch walk,

102
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
what will become of you?

103
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Witches, of course.

104
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Could I fail when you're teaching me?

105
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Well, yeah.

106
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Moomin troll.

107
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Hey.

108
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Are you going out to sea to fish?

109
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
I don't know.

110
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Hemuli told me that he has seen a mamluk fish.

111
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Mamluks?

112
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Hemuli says it is a rare fish and very tasty.

113
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:37,000
We were thinking of going together to see Alisa.

114
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,000
I haven't seen him down either.

115
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,000
I haven't seen him down.

116
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,000
We were thinking of going together to see Alisa.

117
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,000
I haven't seen him in ages either.

118
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Now it would be our turn to go to Alisa.

119
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Snuff!

120
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Hi sell.

121
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Are you coming to the witch too?

122
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
I don't. I won't come.

123
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
He goes fishing.

124
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
See you again.

125
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Where's the knuckles?

126
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Oh, coming soon.

127
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
There will also be a pinch.

128
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Of course not.

129
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
The forest is terribly scary.

130
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Then why did you reverse your decision?

131
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Better to be safe than sorry I thought, but now I'm not sure.

132
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Hey!

133
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Hey!

134
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Hey!

135
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Hey!

136
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Hey!

137
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Hey!

138
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Hey!

139
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Hey!

140
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Hey!

141
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Hey!

142
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Hey!

143
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Hey!

144
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Hey!

145
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Keeh!

146
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Hey!

147
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Fun!

148
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Heilitse, you were a bird yourself!

149
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Pretty stupid if you think about it.

150
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Let's go play with that scion.

151
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
No one is stopping you from coming back.

152
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Don't be silly!

153
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
I wouldn't even be able to get home from here!

154
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Oida Ninja Greatest ever!

Ompas, someone is coming.

159
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:45,440
And it won't, you're just trying to freak out.

160
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:47,440
What sound?

161
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:49,440
Run!

162
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:04,440
Jukranpujut, there's still something glamorous about running around.

163
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:08,440
That sound stopped already.

164
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:11,440
Shall we hide if we hear it again?

165
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:16,440
I hear a voice. The sound is approaching. It comes here.

166
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:18,440
Oh, hide me!

167
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:22,440
Oh, let's see!

168
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:24,440
It's here!

169
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:26,440
Hi Nipsu!

170
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:30,440
Sorry, I almost ran over you.

171
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:31,440
Alisa!

172
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:33,440
Hi, nice to see you.

173
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:35,440
Where are you going?

174
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:38,440
We were coming to see you, Alisa.

175
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:42,440
Häras came along, or because he was so bored?

176
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:44,440
I was coming for you.

177
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:47,440
I would like to show you one particularly difficult witch trick.

178
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:50,440
Great! We have something to show too.

179
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:52,440
Aha!

180
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:56,440
Listen to what I'm telling you.

181
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:59,440
I have finally become a witch.

182
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:01,440
A witch, right?

183
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:03,440
I'm a full witch, almost.

184
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:07,440
Do you like pancakes?

185
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:09,440
That's right!

186
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:14,440
Frogs, porcini mushrooms and crazy cabbage taste great, but variety is refreshing.

187
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:17,440
Are witches not allowed to eat pancakes?

188
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:19,440
Yes, they will.

189
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:21,440
But grandma doesn't know how to fry them.

190
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:23,440
Come on, let the pan fry!

191
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:25,440
I can't do that trick.

192
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,440
Come on, let the pan fry!

193
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:29,440
Come on, let the pan fry!

194
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:31,440
Come on, let the pan fry!

195
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:33,440
Come on, let the pan fry!

196
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:35,440
I can't do that trick.

197
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:40,440
Then he can never eat pancakes and jelly, except in the Moomin house.

198
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:42,440
Terrible.

199
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:45,440
Pölle, the Moomin mom teaches Alisa how to fry.

200
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:48,440
I could come and learn one day.

201
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:50,440
For all I care.

202
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:55,440
I feel like witchcraft isn't all that wonderful.

203
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:58,440
Alisa, when are you going to show what you've learned?

204
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:01,440
Well, anytime, as soon as you want.

205
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:03,440
Then show immediately.

206
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:06,440
Good, let's go to the pond after I eat.

207
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:07,440
To the lake?

208
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,440
Joo.

209
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:14,440
Well Alisa, show me what you can do.

210
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:17,440
Look, I'm showing the walk.

211
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:18,440
A walk?

212
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:20,440
Those walks on the pond.

213
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:23,440
Oh, so you walk on water?

214
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:24,440
I'm walking.

215
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:26,440
Are you sure?

216
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:29,440
I'll save him if something happens.

217
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:31,440
Keep an eye on everything.

218
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:32,440
Wait!

219
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:33,440
What now?

220
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:35,440
Can you hoot?

221
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:36,440
I can't.

222
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:38,440
That would be enough for a teenager.

223
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:40,440
You know the pond is deep.

224
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:43,440
I know, I walk on the surface and not on the bottom.

225
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:46,440
If you wait a bit, I'll bring the boat and...

226
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:48,440
No trouble, believe me.

227
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:51,440
Hey, shut up now.

228
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:52,440
I cast a spell.

229
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:53,440
A spell?

230
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:55,440
A spell that only I can use.

231
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:58,440
I'll have to make a note of that.

232
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:00,440
Papa.

233
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:02,440
Oh, sorry.

234
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:07,440
In the sizzling sarago kannelorum lom.

235
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:10,440
In the sizzling sarago kannelorum lom.

236
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:12,440
Barbarossa of the whistle stable.

237
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:14,440
Tilulilulaa

238
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:28,440
Oh, usko matonda.

239
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:42,440
Impressive!

240
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:46,440
Welcome, let's see you.

241
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:48,440
Welcome, let's see you.

242
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:50,440
Welcome, let's see you.

243
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:52,440
Welcome, let's see you.

244
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:54,440
Impressive!

245
00:11:57,940 --> 00:11:59,940
What a wonder!

246
00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:01,940
Great, Alisa!

247
00:12:01,940 --> 00:12:03,940
Good, Alice!

248
00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:05,940
Good!

249
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:18,940
Listen, if I remembered the Spell, would I be able to walk on water too?

250
00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:20,440
You wouldn't be able to.

251
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:25,940
Ha, first you have to learn to eat rat liver and lizard tongues.

252
00:12:25,940 --> 00:12:28,940
What about me? I eat everything.

253
00:12:28,940 --> 00:12:31,440
Huh? Nothing would come of it now.

254
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:32,440
How so?

255
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:34,440
You wouldn't dare try.

256
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:38,440
None of us are witches.

257
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:42,940
Just speak for yourself, I could do whatever I wanted.

258
00:12:42,940 --> 00:12:45,940
You wouldn't use witchcraft for anything sensible.

259
00:12:45,940 --> 00:12:46,940
As?

260
00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:49,440
To turn stones into gold.

261
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:53,940
Jaha, I'd turn you into a slimy toad.

262
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:55,940
What did I say?

263
00:12:55,940 --> 00:13:00,440
Hey, sell trinkets! Hurry up!

264
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:03,440
You know you don't like toads.

265
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:08,440
What do you think? Can those tricks also be done scientifically?

266
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:11,440
Those tricks are precisely unscientific.

267
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:12,940
I guess so.

268
00:13:12,940 --> 00:13:16,940
I might be able to figure out a way to walk on the surface of the water.

269
00:13:16,940 --> 00:13:18,440
Could you?

270
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:20,440
I wouldn't be surprised.

271
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:29,440
I'm here!

272
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:41,440
Niiskoneiit's turn to be impressed.

273
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:45,440
All right! Now I did!

274
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:52,440
A sniff of muikkune and hemuli!

275
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:58,440
Alisa, you missed me.

276
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:00,440
In the middle of nowhere...

277
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:04,440
No spells, Alisa! You have to catch others!

278
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:14,440
Bye!

279
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:23,440
Alisa, walk snuff to the muikku's boat!

280
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:25,440
Selvon!

281
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:30,440
You're not kidding!

282
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:34,440
Oh hemuli!

283
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:39,440
Alisa has learned these tricks from her grandmother.

284
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:42,440
Nice to see you again!

285
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:45,440
You walk on water.

286
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:47,440
You thought I couldn't?

287
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:49,440
Well indeed.

288
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:53,440
What now?

289
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:56,440
A fish of enormous size lurked below!

290
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:59,440
Mamelukkikala!

291
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,440
Very big!

292
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:03,440
It's a mamluk fish.

293
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:05,440
We try to catch it!

294
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:09,440
I'm a little scared. Can I come on your boat?

295
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:12,440
As long as you keep quiet, of course.

296
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:14,440
Thanks.

297
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:16,440
Good day, hemuli!

298
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:19,440
Good day, ladies!

299
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:22,440
Oh hemuli!

300
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:24,440
Mameluke hooked!

301
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:27,440
Don't run away!

302
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:29,440
Oh wow!

303
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:31,440
Hemuli!

304
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:34,440
Be warned!

305
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:36,440
You caught a mamluk fish!

306
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:42,440
Who asked who?

307
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:44,440
Big fish!

308
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:48,440
Alisa, stop the boat!

309
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:50,440
What?

310
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:52,440
Bring the boat to a stop!

311
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:56,440
Sorry, but all I can do is walk!

312
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:00,440
Mamelukkikala!

313
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:02,440
Uskavuikku, that makes him!

314
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:04,440
This is equivalent to fishing.

315
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:08,440
I don't understand what we do with such a big fish!

316
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:10,440
The line broke.

317
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:13,440
Oh wet! That's what you got!

318
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:16,440
It's getting late.

319
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:18,440
Does your grandma get angry?

320
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:20,440
He hasn't been away himself.

321
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:23,440
But now it's time to go home.

322
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:25,440
Come and play tomorrow too.

323
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:27,440
Can you make it?

324
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:29,440
No.

325
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:31,440
Let's go.

326
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:33,440
Let's go.

327
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:35,440
Let's go.

328
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:37,440
Come and play tomorrow too.

329
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:39,440
Can you make it?

330
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:43,440
It just depends on what mood grandma is in.

331
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:47,440
That's how the step-by-step day of my grandma and partnerships ended.

332
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:53,440
Where did he stay?

333
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:57,440
If you're not in a hurry, I'll go already!

334
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:01,440
What strange thing have you got into your head?

335
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:03,440
What do you mean?

336
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:05,440
Those goddamn tricks.

337
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:09,440
You will think differently when you see what these can be used for.

338
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:23,440
Father, Niisku-neiti and Niisku are coming.

339
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:25,440
Can you walk on water with them?

340
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:27,440
I invented them.

341
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:29,440
Do they stay afloat on their own?

342
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:31,440
Remember to be careful.

343
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:33,440
There is nothing to worry about.

344
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:35,440
Well, now I'll try.

345
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:45,440
Hurrah!

346
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:47,440
I'm ready.

347
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:49,440
I'm ready.

348
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:51,440
I'm ready.

349
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:53,440
Hurrah!

350
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:55,440
What have I said?

351
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:57,440
Science works for these.

352
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:59,440
Anyone can walk...

353
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:01,440
Uhh...

354
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:21,440
Help!

355
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:23,440
Help!

356
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:25,440
Sell, you are my only hope.

357
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:27,440
Trust me, Niisku!

358
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:29,440
Get wet!

359
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:31,440
I'll do anything...

360
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:39,440
Well, as you can see, science trumps witchcraft.

361
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:43,440
Niisku, good water skates only work on my feet.

362
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:45,440
Others are horribly clumsy.

363
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:53,440
This is fun!

364
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:59,440
Ugh!

365
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:05,440
You would think that riding the waves is difficult.

366
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:07,440
Science knows what witches do.

367
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:09,440
I'm not sure.

368
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:11,440
Science is supreme.

369
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:13,440
Are water skis a science?

370
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:25,440
Oh sell, will be back!

371
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:27,440
And it won't!

372
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:29,440
I'm having fun!

373
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:33,440
Come back when I feel like it.

374
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:35,440
Hey!

375
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:41,440
Oho, luhkia silver!

376
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:45,440
Is Hanseen a coward?

377
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:53,440
Sell, watch out!

378
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:57,440
Ugh!

379
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:07,440
I have to admit, you just got better.

380
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:11,440
I wonder myself why bother.

381
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:15,440
Once you're in it, you wouldn't be able to come up with your own spell for me.

382
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:17,440
That's how I would help you with witchcraft.

383
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:19,440
In!

384
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:21,440
You have already saved me twice.

385
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:23,440
I could surprise you sometimes.

386
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:27,440
I miss your surprises in the meantime.
