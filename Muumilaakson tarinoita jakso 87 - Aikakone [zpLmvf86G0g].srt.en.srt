1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
I hear, what are you going to do today?

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Hardly anything special.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Good thing you don't have any other plans.

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Think you could fix a sewing machine?

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Oh, a sewing machine?

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Just like Alalanka pulls annoyingly.

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Dad listen, will you fix my watch too?

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Is it not working properly?

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
No, it always stops.

10
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:31,000
I am very handy in all home appliance and appliance repair work.

11
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Like that.

12
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Jaa.

13
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Dad, here's the clock.

14
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Where do I put it?

15
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Carefully put it aside on that newspaper.

16
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Does that take long?

17
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
You can go.

18
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Let's go.

19
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Let's go.

20
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Let's go.

21
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Let's go.

22
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Let's go.

23
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
You can go.

24
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
In the meantime, you could try to examine the watch yourself.

25
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
I've always wanted to peek inside a watch.

26
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Moomin, what are you doing?

27
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Do you fix your watch?

28
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Will anything come of it?

29
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I would believe so my dear.

30
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Yes, I can fix this.

31
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Interesting, let me correct.

32
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
I want too.

33
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
All right, but be careful.

34
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
I don't want the watch to go to waste.

35
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Hundreds of small strollers.

36
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
I'll rip every one of them off.

37
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Sell, don't just break.

38
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Of course, I'll fix it.

39
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
This would make a beautiful pendant.

40
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Won't come, don't.

41
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
It was fun fixing the clock.

42
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Really.

43
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,000
You wouldn't have had to remove all the parts.

44
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,000
When I do something, I do it properly.

45
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Dad, look at this.

46
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
I can't get the gear out.

47
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Wait and see.

48
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Isn't this about...

49
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Let's move the parts of the watch separately from the parts of the sewing machine.

50
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Joo.

51
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Now.

52
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
What do we do now?

53
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
No sweat.

54
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
No sweat.

55
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:29,000
I have a perfect memory of what the insides of a watch and a sewing machine look like.

56
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Really?

57
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
I'll fix the sewing machine first.

58
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
The remaining parts belong to the watch.

59
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Muuvipapa always finds a way.

60
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Can it be successful?

61
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Kill the worry.

62
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
May I come to your aid?

63
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
And me?

64
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Me too.

65
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
This fits here.

66
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
I guess the spring belongs somewhere in here.

67
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
The strap comes here.

68
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Let's see.

69
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Fits perfectly.

70
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
This part looks great here.

71
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
I turn the lamp here.

72
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
That's it now.

73
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
It doesn't look the same as before.

74
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Well, you could be right about that.

75
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
A strange sewing machine!

76
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Dad, there were no parts left in the watch.

77
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
I guess you're right.

78
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
What do we do now?

79
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:39,000
It may not be Tismale's former sewing machine, but what is it?

80
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Mamma, can you answer that?

81
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
No, I can't.

82
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
A sewing clock with a shadow!

83
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
One part is left over.

84
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Where would it be put?

85
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Moomin, please go and get the magnetic tool box.

86
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Joo.

87
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Thanks.

88
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Oh!

89
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
What was it? Time block huh?

90
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
I suspect the magnetic field.

91
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Moomin, don't we have an old radio somewhere in the corner?

92
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Yes, but it doesn't work.

93
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Bring it here, though, now.

94
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Clear.

95
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:39,000
If my calculations match, there should be a strong magnetic field, maybe also an electric field.

96
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
What is it?

97
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
So.

98
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Moomin, are you doing something to the machine?

99
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:53,000
There, I twisted this wheel a bit.

100
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Who are you?

101
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
How so? We are you.

102
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Why do you look like me?

103
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:15,000
I look like you because you are me.

104
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Are we related?

105
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Good miracle, but I'm you.

106
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
who are you

107
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
What do you mean?

108
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
I am you.

109
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
I am you.

110
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
I am you.

111
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Welcome, I'm making tea.

112
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Good unusual.

113
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
They disappeared.

114
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Who were those twin beings?

115
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Where did they go from here?

116
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Yay, I think we've put together a pretty remarkable machine.

117
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Let me now put back the part that fell from me.

118
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Well, here it is.

119
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:01,000
The gear should fit in this slot.

120
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Dad, now the machine starts again.

121
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Share, share, let's see.

122
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Dad, what's going on now?

123
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
No gray warping.

124
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Let's see, the hands of the clock are turning backwards.

125
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
What?

126
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
True.

127
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Good to scare.

128
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Aaah, what's going on now?

129
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Father.

130
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
That must be it.

131
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Namely, a time machine.

132
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:49,000
I have read about it, but that they really exist.

133
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Time machine.

134
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:55,000
It takes you to the past or the future wherever you want.

135
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
It's the same thing.

136
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Now I understand.

137
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:09,000
We see ourselves as we were a few minutes ago.

138
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Just like that.

139
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Who are you? How so?

140
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
We are you.

141
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Why do you look like me?

142
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:21,000
I look like you because you are me.

143
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Maybe we're related, but you're me.

144
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
who are you

145
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
What do you mean?

146
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
I am you.

147
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
I am me.

148
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
I am you.

149
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
I am you.

150
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
I am you.

151
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
I am you.

152
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:47,000
We all go back to the past again.

153
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
I want to go now.

154
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:57,000
It's not a problem when you've built a great machine yourself and also know how to use it.

155
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:01,000
So let's go back in time.

156
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Tel!

157
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Where have we come?

158
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
What era have we entered?

159
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
I don't know.

160
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Father look, just like lonely mountains.

161
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
We are lonely mountains.

162
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Where is the Moomin house?

163
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
All I see are huge trees!

164
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:44,000
I would guess that the place we are in is an ancient Moomin valley.

165
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,000
It looks different today.

166
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
It seems so.

167
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Calm down, I know how to treat natives.

168
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
We are under siege!

169
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
It scares me.

170
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
What do we do?

171
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,000
You must not fall into the grip of fear of flight.

172
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Hey there you pale-faced friends of ours, we're up to no harm.

173
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Father!

174
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Cereal!

175
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Who are they?

176
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,000
They look like blue Moomin to me.

177
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Are they our ancestors?

178
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Isn't it just my boy.

179
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,000
I hope they were vegetarians.

180
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Good day!

181
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Hey start stop!

182
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,000
They'll probably start checking if we're fit to eat.

183
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,000
That's how it seems.

184
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
How are they going?

185
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,000
How big is the welcome bonfire?

186
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,000
I don't think there is a welcome bonfire.

187
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Well, not for sure!

188
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,000
They roast us over a campfire.

189
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,000
This is no longer a joke.

190
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:27,000
I've always said I don't like relatives.

191
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Best to leave.

192
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Mielumi right away.

193
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Vuh! Vuh! Vuh! Vuh! Vuh! Vuh! Vuh! Vuh!

194
00:10:55,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Vuh! Vuh! Vuh! Vuh! Vuh! Vuh! Vuh! Vuh!

195
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Father, what will be done to these three?

196
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
I can't evict them.

197
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,000
We have no choice.

198
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Looks like they have to be included.

199
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Speed up!

200
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Nice to get home!

201
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Yes, we are back in the time we left.

202
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
What a relief.

203
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Traveling is overrated. Luckily I was there.

204
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Dad is watching.

205
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Please come and have afternoon tea.

206
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Oh mom, we were just on a big adventure.

207
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
That was cool.

208
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Did my sewing machine have something to do with it?

209
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Mamma honey, it's not a sewing machine anymore.

210
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Right?

211
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Oh, and tell me, who are these three weird-looking hairballs?

212
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,000
They are our ancestors.

213
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Or really ancestors?

214
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
What does that mean?

215
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,000
From the Stone Age Moomins with a time machine.

216
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
And it was fun!

217
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,000
We were almost roasted alive over a campfire.

218
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Well, it all hurts.

219
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,000
However, you survived unscathed.

220
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Would the ancestors like tea and cookies?

221
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
No you, you.

222
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:46,000
It seems to me that the ancestors enjoy us.

223
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Let's hope so.

224
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Aivas papa, what are we doing?

225
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:00,000
We mustn't pay too much attention to him.

226
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Not then, I guess.

227
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,000
What did you do with that, ancestor?

228
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,000
I guess you can't change your ancestors.

229
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Probably not.

230
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Ancestor, where are you going?

231
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Oh, those were my favorite dishes.

232
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Pappa is our ancestor.

233
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
What happens now?

234
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
What was it?

235
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Au!

236
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
What on earth?

237
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
What was that?

238
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
What was that?

239
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
What was that?

240
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
What was that?

241
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
What was that?

242
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
What was that?

243
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
What was that?

244
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
What was that?

245
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
What on earth?

246
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Me too.

247
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
I can't do that kind of destruction.

248
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Father, the ancestors invented a trap door to the basement.

249
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
So it seems.

250
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Oh no, now they're eating our food supply.

251
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
It must be prevented.

252
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
No, no, no.

253
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Oh, oh, oh.

254
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
They have a lot of food.

255
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Oh, Dad.

256
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Oh, mom.

257
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Let's come.

258
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Möö and Niskunneit, come help.

259
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:40,000
The ancestors do not know what these cans and jars are.

260
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
What's wrong with you?

261
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
What are you squealing?

262
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Don't aim that gun at me.

263
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Teach, ancestor.

264
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Father they have taken your hunting colors.

265
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
So it appears.

266
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
I got it in the back of the chamber.

267
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:04,000
How could they find it?

268
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Isn't the rifle dangerous?

269
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,000
No, it has not been loaded.

270
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Help.

271
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
A pinch of extract.

272
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Hanissaa.

273
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
The Moomin troll will help.

274
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
I have to go.

275
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
The Moomin troll helps.

276
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
A pinch.

277
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Welcome to the slowdowns when I felt the door.

278
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,000
What are they going to do to me?

279
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Ai-ai-ai, ai-ai.

280
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Help.

281
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Help.

282
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Good morning!

283
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:49,000
I'm afraid that the ancestors think the nip is in good taste.

284
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:52,000
That's where they come in handy!

285
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,000
We cannot leave a pinch to the mercy of the ancestors.

286
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Try to bring Nipsu back to us.

287
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Yes, but how?

288
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Tell him to run this way.

289
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
OK, I'll click.

290
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Guess I've been the one to do that too! You shouldn't eat me!

291
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
It sounded like a hoot.

292
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
What was he in such a hurry to do?

293
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Oh, what a species! This is a great find!

294
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Help! We will be killed!

295
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Nipsu, come here!

296
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Remind?

297
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Here!

298
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,000
No more!

299
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Ancestors!

300
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:42,000
I'm sure of the species definition.

301
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,000
This is a miracle, a real stroke of luck.

302
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:49,000
The greatest discovery of the century in the field of biology.

303
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Nipsu, you are my witness. You saw them too.

304
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Are those hair tufts a great find?

305
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:00,000
Remarkable. I saw the ancestors in Hemul's garden.

306
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,000
Look at this book, Nipsu.

307
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:07,000
I have studied these things for a long time.

308
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:12,000
Here are the ancient Moomins who lived in Moominvalley long ago.

309
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:16,000
They were just such fluffy heads that ran at my heels.

310
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Right. Ancestral or ancient Moomins lived here thousands of years ago.

311
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Well, then how is it possible that they are against me in the present time of the world?

312
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Tell me, their family is supposed to have died a long time ago.

313
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:38,000
And now they're here to chase you around Moomin Valley.

314
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:42,000
Can you imagine anything more exciting?

315
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,000
Such a revolutionary discovery is already quite valuable.

316
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Without a doubt. Perhaps worthy of a university position.

317
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:52,000
Let's agree that I'll take the money and you get the position, Joako.

318
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
Oh horrible.

319
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
What? Hemu?

320
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:01,000
Yes, he invited the press and research team to Moominvalley.

321
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
Honey, what are we doing?

322
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,000
I suspect there will be some problems.

323
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,000
I am sure that the ancestors will be tried to be caught.

324
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:14,000
I do think that is much easier said than done.

325
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,000
I hope so.

326
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:18,000
But where are the ancestors, Pekko?

327
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Oh, I forgot.

328
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
Remember what you had to do.

329
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
I'll go back.

330
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
Keep your fingers crossed.

331
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:31,000
If Hemuli can't find the ancestors, we're in trouble.

332
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
Don't worry, Daddy.

333
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
I have an inch.

334
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
Do not! Tell me that.

335
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
Soon you will see.

336
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:42,000
The hit of the day, will you come to help?

337
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
Of course me.

338
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,000
It's so exciting that your stomach churns.

339
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,000
In a pinch!

340
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,000
Don't drag it out.

341
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
Get in the cage for it already.

342
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
Are you sure I'm safe?

343
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
You are you are. No danger.

344
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Being baited by ancestors scares me.

345
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,000
But getting rich is tempting.

346
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
Shut your mouth now and into the cage.

347
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:12,000
Remember, Hemuli, that I have only promised for a moment.

348
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:21,000
I hope the ancestors are okay and haven't been caught.

349
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,000
Come on, hey!

350
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:25,000
I guess you're safe there?

351
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
Now they come.

352
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,000
Good.

353
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
Ouch! They are here.

354
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
They go to help.

355
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,000
Help!

356
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
Hemuli, they're killing me.

357
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:46,000
Now if they poke me in the cheek, a ghost will appear for you.

358
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
Help!

359
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
What now?

360
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
Ancestors.

361
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
What is it about?

362
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,000
The ancestors came back when they smelled mother's roasts.

363
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
I finely chop the vegetables.

364
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
I, for my part, tasted it.

365
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:20,000
True. Myy and Niiskuneiti helped me.

366
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:24,000
Look, the ancestors fell asleep.

367
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
Stomach full.

368
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
Now is the right time.

369
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
Be careful, papa.

370
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:37,000
While they sleep, we send them back to their own time.

371
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
Now I start.

372
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
Ancestors were lost.

373
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
It's all over now.

374
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:54,000
I guess this is what it feels like after a hurricane.

375
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,000
I think that Hemuli will be very disappointed.

376
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:02,000
Yes, but has our Hemuli got a new interesting hobby?

377
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
Mother, what do you mean?

378
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:08,000
Yeah, yeah. He gets to search for ancient mummies for the rest of his life.

379
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:11,000
Is that what you mean, Moomin?

380
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:14,000
That, even if you feel sorry for him.
