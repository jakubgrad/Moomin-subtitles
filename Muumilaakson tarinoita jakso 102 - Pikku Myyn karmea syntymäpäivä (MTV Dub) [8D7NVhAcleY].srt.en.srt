1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
From the last one

2
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
It's a beautiful day! Good morning, birds!

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Have you had a goddamn breakfast?

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Do you happen to know what day it is today?

5
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
I'll tell.

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Today is, listen, my birthday!

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Holy look!

8
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Goodbye!

9
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
What kind of party is there something for me to organize?

10
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I have to admit that I miss you.

11
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Juli will definitely have a lot of guests and I will get a big pile of gifts.

12
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Favorite food is served there, such as lemonade and cookies

13
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
and of course birthday cake!

14
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
I can't wait!

15
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Good morning!

16
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Good morning!

17
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I can help!

18
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Listen, little girl, do you know what day it is today?

19
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
No, but it says so in the newspaper.

20
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Well, my big grin might help you remember!

21
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Well, that's covered before breakfast.

22
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Covered before breakfast.

23
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Nipsu, Do you know what day it is today?

24
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Don't you know?

25
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
I know.

26
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
I guessed it, dear Nipsu!

27
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Well, tell me, what day is it?

28
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,000
It is yesterday's tomorrow, in other words, now is today.

29
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Wiseacre!

30
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Nipsu, shall we go fishing?

31
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:54,000
That would be nice, but wouldn't you rather go to the lonely mountains?

32
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Good idea, it's been a while since the last time.

33
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Hey, you don't have time to go so far that you bigots don't remember that today is...

34
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Mom, Little My is terribly hungry, is breakfast ready yet?

35
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
It's ready, sorry for making you wait.

36
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Little Myy, you know you can't talk in your mouth.

37
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Then everyone to eat.

38
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Grandma, I have something important to do.

39
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Goodness.

40
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
What now?

41
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
The pot was left on the stove.

42
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Strange behavior, what's the matter?

43
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Now listen, I have something to do.

44
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
No need to shout like that.

45
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Even more important.

46
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Now shut up, today is my...

47
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Help, mouse!

48
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Where, where, where is the mouse, what did it go to?

49
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Oh, it was just a dust rag.

50
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
You know you need glasses.

51
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Yes, I was just about to say that...

52
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Small breads are better.

53
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Yes, donuts are better.

54
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Mamma's donut pretzels are delicious.

55
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
I also think the donuts are better.

56
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
What do you say, Little Myy?

57
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
What are you talking about?

58
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Which ones do we ask mom?

59
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
It doesn't matter at all.

60
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Well, donuts then.

61
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Donut rings.

62
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
And after breakfast, you weed the flower bed.

63
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Joo.

64
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
I'll come to help.

65
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Let's hurry then.

66
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Why is everyone so weird today?

67
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
All right.

68
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
I'm disappearing.

69
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Pikku Myi had a terrible time.

70
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Now it makes me angry.

71
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
No one remembered that it was my birthday.

72
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Hemp!

73
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
I want to hear someone say that

74
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
hi, today is Little My's birthday.

75
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
So that the plastic troll and everyone can hear.

76
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Hemuli gets permission to handle the matter.

77
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Good morning, Hemuli.

78
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Oh hey, Little Myy, you're up early this morning.

79
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
What are you doing squatting here?

80
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
I was looking for a new type of grass that I heard about.

81
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Oh, but do you remember what day it is today?

82
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Well, I don't remember, but I'm sure somewhere in the world today is also a holiday.

83
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
I'm looking at me, so you remember?

84
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Really, really.

85
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
You remembered?

86
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
I have to return one of the police chief's books.

87
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
I didn't mean it, today is mine.

88
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Here it is now.

89
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Listen to me.

90
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Now it was found.

91
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:33,000
At last and finally kraminulosis spike formis to think.

92
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
No doubt, this is a new species.

93
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
It's my birthday, you hear?

94
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Today I discovered a brand new species of grass.

95
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Today is my lucky day.

96
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:53,000
I wouldn't have been able to understand that they were screaming so loud.

97
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Yes?

98
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Nuuska Muikkonen, of course.

99
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:03,000
He is Granny's best friend, so he gets to tell everyone that today is my birthday.

100
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:08,000
I'm pretty sure that Nuuska Muikkonen won't beat me at shouting.

101
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,000
At least I've never heard him scream.

102
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Good morning, Nuuska Muikkonen.

103
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Good morning, Little Myy.

104
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Today is my birthday.

105
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:25,000
I just wanted to make sure everyone remembered it and that the party was organized and the cake was baked and the presents were bought.

106
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:35,000
I'm afraid that everyone has forgotten it, so could you go and tell everyone in Moomintala that, oh yes, it's Pikkum's birthday today, that a cake has been baked and si...

107
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Yes?

108
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Muikkonen's banana!

109
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Or is breakfast more important to you than me?

110
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Pretty rude too, fool!

111
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Ah, there's Viljonkka.

112
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Good morning, Viljonkka.

113
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Little Myy, are you out for a morning walk?

114
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Do you even know what day it is today?

115
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Today? I don't know, but I know what day yesterday was.

116
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Well, what day was yesterday?

117
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Yesterday was my birthday.

118
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:16,000
To think! And today is my birthday.

119
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Other people's birthdays are boring. Goodbye!

120
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Yes?

121
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:28,000
This will be remembered even by you, my dear, Irppanokka!

122
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,000
How has everyone forgotten my birthday?

123
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:36,000
If I had a real family, they would definitely throw me a party.

124
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,000
How did I forget?

125
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:44,000
I have a family! Mymmeli will organize the party for sure!

126
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Good morning, Mymmeli!

127
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Good morning, Little Myy. It's good that you came.

128
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:54,000
I have a little problem because everyone else has gone out.

129
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Mymmeli needs a housekeeper because she is going on errands.

130
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,000
I have to go. I guess I'm already a little late.

131
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
I thought so.

132
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:08,000
You take care of the house. And please. Then don't mess up the places here.

133
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Now. I'll see you later.

134
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000
What the hell Mymmelik Petty me.

135
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,000
My birthday only comes once a year.

136
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Maybe no one will even want to congratulate me despite that.

137
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,000
It's good then. I organize my own parties.

138
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:30,000
I cook a festive meal, bake a cake and sing a congratulatory song to myself.

139
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,000
I'll clean up the tracks before Mymmeli comes back.

140
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Oops. You can find anything here.

141
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Jahs. I think it's wisest to bake the cake first.

142
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Chicken eggs. Sugar.

143
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Win. Flour.

144
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Night.

145
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,000
If there is will, there is also skill.

146
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,000
This is going to be a mouthful.

147
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Then the onions are difficult.

148
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Shredding only pays for crying.

149
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Just there. About. And salt.

150
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,000
No! No! I did something.

151
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,000
After all, this was pepper.

152
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
No!

153
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,000
It was supposed to hurt.

154
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Hedelmäpoli is my favorite drink.

155
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,000
First the syrup.

156
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Oranges. Apples.

157
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Grapes.

158
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,000
And you don't skimp on sugar anyway.

159
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Then we mix.

160
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Let's taste it.

161
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Too sweet.

162
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,000
With the intestine, it is corrected.

163
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Now that should be appropriate.

164
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Let's taste.

165
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Terribly bad.

166
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:13,000
It's only bad if I throw everything possible into the mix.

167
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Bring a little and drink this.

168
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:20,000
The most important thing is inspiration and fresh ingredients.

169
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:24,000
It is also an advantage to know how to enjoy good food.

170
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,000
It's a moment worth feasting on.

171
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Of ore.

172
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,000
It doesn't look very tasty.

173
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:37,000
The food is cooked by me, so it can't be that bad.

174
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,000
It smells burnt.

175
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,000
I forgot the cake is in the oven.

176
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Oh, oh, oh.

177
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Now this is starting to resemble a festive meal.

178
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Too bad there are only two candles.

179
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,000
That's it, done.

180
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Then I can start.

181
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:24,000
I think this is how I raise a toast to the hero at first.

182
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Little My, happy birthday.

183
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Oh, thank you.

184
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:37,000
And that's how Pikku Myy is one step closer to adulthood.

185
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,000
I'm not, I was kidding.

186
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:44,000
The table has been set in Korean for you, Little Myy.

187
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Just taste.

188
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Shall I start?

189
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Doesn't it taste good?

190
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Yeah, it's good.

191
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Mention something you like.

192
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Taste this too.

193
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Yeah, this is really good too.

194
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,000
It's a delicious smell.

195
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,000
You look beautiful today.

196
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Thank you, beautifully said.

197
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,000
This is what I look like.

198
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,000
I'll take a piece of this cake.

199
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Yes, please.

200
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Terrible food.

201
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,000
That's enough now.

202
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,000
I can't talk to myself.

203
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Feeling twice as miserable.

204
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Stinker, come in there.

205
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Hey, Stinkbug, are you in a hurry?

206
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Me? Well, it isn't.

207
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Slippery.

208
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Then come celebrate my birthday.

209
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,000
What? Birthday party?

210
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Why don't you?

211
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Well, Ansa, you must be trying to block me,

212
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,000
or do something else annoying.

213
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,000
I'm nice and kind.

214
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Why would I do that? I invite you to be my guest.

215
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,000
As a guest? Me? Yes, you.

216
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Really? Really.

217
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Are you absolutely sure?

218
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Of course I'm sure. Well, are you coming or not?

219
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:26,000
I'll come. Of course.

220
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Let's go to the end.

221
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Am I the only guest? You are, come to the table.

222
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Yes, it looks delicious.

223
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Really? That's all, if you want.

224
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Can you eat all of these?

225
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Ha ha ha, oh guys, thanks.

226
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Wait a minute.

227
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Don't you have anything to say to me?

228
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,000
What? Ah, yes, of course.

229
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Happy birthday. Thanks.

230
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,000
That's what I've been waiting for. Then we'll eat.

231
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,000
It's good.

232
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:08,000
What is this?

233
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Oh, mention the idea of coming here.

234
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Jaa.

235
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Never before had such a wonderfully returned second.

236
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Yes, it's rare that it got a little rough.

237
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,000
I like everything burnt.

238
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Is it good? You are a forward cook.

239
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Apparently I'm going to have to change my mind game about you little one.

240
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Just thank you.

241
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,000
I wish someone else had said those words.

242
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:58,000
I hope the little girl has behaved herself.

243
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,000
I've heard talk of the Stinking statue being a caboose,

244
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:10,000
but I didn't dare it to be true.

245
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Did you say something? I'm talking in the middle of nowhere.

246
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:16,000
I'm sure you'll eat it all then. I eat, I eat.

247
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Mymmeli. The party ends.

248
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Sting the last turtu applies.

249
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:26,000
I still have two left. I can't wait.

250
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
What are you going to do?

251
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Mouth open for bigger.

252
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:34,000
I can't even taste it now.

253
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,000
When you're done eating, you jump out of that window.

254
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:40,000
I'm here for dessert.

255
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,000
Go already. Bye. Now I'm in a game of tees.

256
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Pymmeli is a mess.

257
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,000
We are at home.

258
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Did you take good care of the house?

259
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Or are you taking a nap?

260
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:02,000
I'd love a cup now.

261
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Oh.

262
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:08,000
I'm playing tees.

263
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Pymmeli is a mess.

264
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:14,000
We are at home.

265
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Did you take good care of the house?

266
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Uhhhhhh!

267
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Little one. What has happened here?

268
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Sell! Wake up!

269
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Pymmeli. Greetings. Did you come back already?

270
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Little one. What the hell has happened here?

271
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:46,000
What? What are you talking about?

272
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Erranjestas is very clean.

273
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Admit it was you.

274
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
Me? How so?

275
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
Well, who else could it have been.

276
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:59,000
I think the rats might have messed up the kitchen.

277
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:03,000
I could hear rustling from the kitchen through my sleep.

278
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Or rats? Or that way?

279
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Then you have nothing to worry about.

280
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:13,000
I was already scared that you had eaten this.

281
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
What was in that jar?

282
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Hair growth cream.

283
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Hair growth?

284
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
It makes hair grow.

285
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
I accidentally left it in the kitchen.

286
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:26,000
What would happen if you could drink it, for example?

287
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:30,000
I don't know. I miss it, it could get really hairy.

288
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,000
As hairy as a skunk.

289
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Is that what you mean?

290
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:41,000
But you don't have to think about it if the rats drank it.

291
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
They are already furry.

292
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
Now I have to clean up.

293
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
I'm leaving.

294
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
What are you suddenly in a hurry to do?

295
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Goodbye then. Thank you for being a caretaker.

296
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,000
There is no hair growth cream.

297
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:06,000
Nymmeli is just trying to scare me.

298
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:09,000
On the other hand, how do you know that?

299
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
It can't be true.

300
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:14,000
My stomach twists strangely.

301
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:20,000
Oh, anyway. Are you sure you haven't eaten anything inappropriate?

302
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
In.

303
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:25,000
Well good. Grandma's medicine will surely help soon.

304
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Thank you, Moomin.

305
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:30,000
A little nap would definitely help.

306
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
What do I do now?

307
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,000
If it was hair growth cream I drank,

308
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:40,000
I'm sure he'll be fine if I sleep for a while?

309
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:47,000
Ha ha ha ha ha! You have a weird hairstyle.

310
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:51,000
You really didn't drink hair growth cream.

311
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Kikkuli is a real gem.

312
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Teach me! Did you hear?

313
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
Did you hear?

314
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
Oh, it was just a dream.

315
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:16,000
It was a weighty one. I feel better now.

316
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Is there someone there?

317
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:27,000
Who there? Don't be intimidated. Did you hear?

318
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Is there anyone there?

319
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
who are you

320
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
It can't be.

321
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:42,000
Not even though these are my hands. Then he.

322
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:48,000
Oh no! That can't be my face.

323
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,000
Am I a furry monster?

324
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:56,000
Terrible! What the hell do I do now? Help me.

325
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
Good luck, Little Myy.

326
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
What?

327
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:10,000
Just like in that dream. No, you can't watch.

328
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
That suits you.

329
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
That's fine.

330
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
Teasing!

331
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:19,000
Come on, that's enough.

332
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:27,000
What? What the hell is this?

333
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,000
We dressed you in a fancy dress while you were asleep.

334
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:34,000
We thought it would be a good punishment.

335
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:37,000
Why the hell did you have to punish me?

336
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:41,000
You mess up Mymmel's kitchen in an absolutely impossible condition.

337
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:45,000
Oh, you knew about that. You can tell when you're lying.

338
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:49,000
Selling a Parka, or celebrating birthdays with Haisuli?

339
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
The skunk was happy.

340
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:55,000
The reason is yours. You forgot my birthday.

341
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
Little Myy, don't be funny.

342
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:01,000
How on earth could we forget your birthday?

343
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:04,000
You were mean to me this morning.

344
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:09,000
We just wanted to keep it a secret that we were planning a big party for you.

345
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:14,000
God bless you. You must have felt terribly lonely.

346
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:19,000
Cheers, cheers. Mind you, he destroyed my entire kitchen.

347
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
Sorry I lied.

348
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:26,000
You will be forgiven. Here is your birthday present.

349
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
Oh, thank you.

350
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:32,000
I left home because I had to buy a light red bow.

351
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,000
Yes, it is beautiful.

352
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:41,000
Well, now that everything is settled, let's start the festivities. Let's sing.

353
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:45,000
Good luck, good luck.

354
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:49,000
Good luck, Little Myy, good luck.

355
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:55,000
Happy birthday, Little Myy.

356
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
Here's the perfect gift for you.

357
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
Here's my gift.

358
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,000
Please, Little Myy.

359
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,000
I did this myself and it took an awful lot of time.

360
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:06,000

00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
I hope you like this gift.

362
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:12,000
The table has all your favorite foods and treats.

363
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:16,000
And you don't have to worry about getting hairy.

364
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,000
Good luck.

365
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
Good luck.

366
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
Good luck.
